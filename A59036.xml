            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">R</seg>ENEWED heart is a very Heaven in our little world, and Faith is the onely Sun in that
<pb facs="tcp:58851:3"/> Heaven. The ſinner ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver comes to be preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, till he comes to be pious; and the value of that piety ſtill advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth, according to the quantity of true faith, as the Ring is the more conſiderable with the Diamond. I cannot conceive of a more compendious way for any Chriſtians full and conſtant revenues, then this, To get faith, and ſtil to uſe it: The ſumme or product of which would be this, Grace
<pb facs="tcp:58851:3"/> and Glory, Heaven and Earth are ours.</p>
            <p>Satan well knowes what a ſerviceable chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nell Faith is for all our traffique, either for our ſhip to lanch out into duties, or for Gods ſhip to come laden in to us with mercies: &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there is no Grace which hee batters, and conflicts ſo with, as with faith: If we wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken or ſhake foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, this hath a ſpread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing influence into the whole building: A
<pb facs="tcp:58851:4"/> Chriſtians faith cannot be wronged, but pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently all the ſpirituall frame becomes ſenſible of wrong and loſſe.</p>
            <p>In my weak judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, it were a great prudence to ſecure that, which being ſecured, now ſecures all. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing grows weake, where faith growes ſtrong. My Lord, This poore Treatiſe which I preſume to front with your name, is like <hi>Aaron</hi> and <hi>Hur,</hi> who ſtaid up the hands of <hi>Moſes;</hi> So
<pb facs="tcp:58851:4"/> doth this Treatiſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to ſtay the hand of faith in a weak Beleever, who hath an ample eſtate on the ſhore and at land; but thoſe waves of doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings (when he is thruſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in) too often make him to fall back and ſtagger: Whence fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes this great unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe, That whereas his faith might have ſerved in many preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous comforts, it is (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt a whole life) im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed onely to anſwer

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, was (many years paſt) the ſubject of my pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Meditations and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons. I did not affect any farther publication of it, then in the Pulpit; but the importunity of others hath
<pb facs="tcp:58851:7"/> compelled it thus to appeare in print: Not that the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of handling the Subject (here inſiſted on) is excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent or exquiſite, but that the matter handled may be ſuppoſed to be of common uſe and benefit; as a little ſtar hath influence, though not that glory which is proper to the Sun.</p>
            <p>The Caſe which is here put, and diſcuſſed, is a Caſe of common experience: There is no Beleever, but ſome time or other will confeſſe it is his. The Sun being ſeated in an heavenly Orbe, ſhineth
<pb facs="tcp:58851:7"/> with a very pure and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant light, but the candle (though ſet and burning in a golden candleſtick, yet) burnes with a ſnuffe, and much variableneſſe. When Chriſtians are tranſlated, and tranſplanted from earth to heaven, then their graces ſhall become perfections: There are no defects in heaven, there are no mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures in heaven, but whatſoever is pure there, it is altogether pure: Yet on earth it is otherwiſe, neither the habits of Grace, nor the acts of Grace are alone <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

            <p>Where is the Beleever who inſiſts not more on his fears then on his faith? and is not oftner lamenting his doubts, then rejoycing in his aſſurances? None have an intereſt in Chriſt, but Belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers; None have title to a ſolid and ſettled peace, but they: And yet we ſee the children fearfull, and bond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
<pb facs="tcp:58851:8"/> confident; the beſt of men ſtill in ſuit, and the worſt of men quiet, as if in full poſſeſsion; none doubting leſſe then ſuch as have moſt cauſe to doubt, and none doubting more then ſuch as have moſt cauſe to triumph in Chriſt. And in truth thus it will be whiles groſse igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance veiles over preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous ſinners, and miſ-belief is incident to tender ſpirits.</p>
            <p>And is not the hand of <hi>Joab</hi> in this buſineſse too? Is not Satan in all the ſins of wicked men, and in moſt of the troubles of good men?
<pb facs="tcp:58851:9"/> either he tempts us to ſinne, and that will cauſe us to doubt; or elſe he tempts us to doubt, and that will cauſe us to ſin. Surely it is not the ſhorteſt of his wiles and arts, in matters of Religion, to keep the judgements of ſome ſtill ſtaggering; and in matters of a ſoules intereſt in Chriſt, to keep the heart ſtill doubting. Doth he not know that the Chriſtian cannot ſo happily improve Chriſt, who is ſtill in ſuit to prove his title to Chriſt?</p>

                  <hi>CAP. I.</hi> The nature of Doubtings.</head>
               <p>TO underſtand this, you <note place="margin">Four qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities in the ſoule. Joh. 12. 48 Heb. 12. 25</note> muſt know, that in the worſt part of the ſoul, there are ſeverall qualities, <hi>viz.</hi> 1. Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity, which ſtrictly and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt thoſe which profeſſe the Goſpel, is a poſitive rejecting of heavenly truths, with their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret goodneſſe; herein men for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake their owne mercies by plain diſſents and ſleightings of the good word of grace: as is evident in the Phariſees, <hi>Luk.</hi> 7. 30. who rejected the counſell of God, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>2. Deſpaire, which is a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt diſſent, not ſo much in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the thing, or object, (for this is aſſented unto as true in reſpect of it ſelfe, <hi>viz.</hi> That God is mercifull, and Chriſt did die for ſinners) but in reſpect of the perſon or ſubject, wherein
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:58851:15"/> the ſoule gives up it ſelf as loſt, as without the compaſſe and <note place="margin">As <hi>Jer.</hi> 2. 25. <hi>There is no hope:</hi> no.</note> hopefulneſſe of the divine pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation: It is perſwaded that there is no poſſibility for it to recover the ſhore, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſinks in the depths: My meaning is, That ſuch a ſoule, <note place="margin">Eſa. 38. 18 <hi>They that goe down into the pit cannot hope for thy truth:</hi> This holds not onely in the pit of the grave, but alſo in the pit of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpaire.</note> though it ſees that in God, and that in Chriſt which can ſave, and doth ſave others, yet cuts off it ſelf as not at all capable of any intereſt in the mercie of God, or bloud of Chriſt, and ſo eternally falls under its owne weight, as is evident in <hi>Judas</hi> and <hi>Cain.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now Deſpaire, ſo farre as it makes aſſent unto Truths, it is oppoſed unto Infidelity; and ſo farre as it diſſents from ſpeciall goodneſſe in them, it is oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to Faith; and ſo farre as it concludes impoſſibility of that good unto it ſelfe, it is oppoſed to Hope.</p>
               <p>3. Fearfull opinions, which
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:58851:16"/> are poſitive aſſents unto Truths, yet raiſed upon ſuch probable inducements onely, that the ſoule is left with a ſuſpition, that the contrary may be true. They are like a man upon a <note place="margin">Simile.</note> weak plank in a great river, there he ſits, and there he fears, becauſe he knows not certainly how long he ſhall ſit there.</p>
               <p>4. Doubtings, which are the ſuſpenſions or inhibitions (the holdings up) of the ſoule from any determinate inclinations one way or other: they are the pawſings of the mind.</p>
               <p>As take a man in a journey, <note place="margin">Simile.</note> where he meets with two waies, he looks on this, and inclines it may be the right, and then he looks on that, and ſuppoſeth that it may be the right, and then he looks upon both, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>at a ſtand, there is no turning either to the right hand nor to the left. Therefore the School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men ſay well, that <hi>Dubitatio eſt motus ſupra utram<expan>

               </p>
               <p>That you may yet conceive <note place="margin">3. Things to be fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved.</note> this clearly, remember 1. In our minds there are Aſſentings, which are the adherents of the underſtanding to truths known: And there are Diſſentings, which are the bearings off from thoſe truths. There the ſoule poſitively inclines, here it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clines; there it puts out the hand, and here it keeps it in.</p>

               <p>Whereupon the ſoule miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gives, How can my condition be good, which differs ſo much from the ſecret and lively diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions of Grace? How can it be good which is ſo unanſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to that quickneſſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed, and found in the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God? How can I bee good, who about the actions of good am ſo dull and heavy, awkeward and flow? &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But then, ſuppoſe the ſoule can cleare and aſſoyle it ſelf from this feare, (by know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that fire may be where it doth not alwayes flame, and the root may live where the branches do not alwayes flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh, and by finding ſome an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable dulneſſes in ſome e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent <hi>Davids,</hi> who often have prayed for quickning)
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:58851:42"/> yet there ariſeth another doubting from our dulneſſe and indiſpoſition, which is a feare of acceptance, The Lord will not accept of theſe ſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, becauſe they are ſo heavy, they are therefore without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny efficacie. Suppoſe I may be good, yet they are bad, and can win no favour with God. Thus the ſoule is oft-times much perplexed by reaſon of its indiſpoſitions; as if either it were totally bad, or God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended little good unto it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is not quickned, and more enlivened in the ſervices preſented unto him.

A ſeventh ſpring or oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions <note place="margin">A ſeventh cauſe of doubtings</note> of doubtings may be fruitleſſe indeavours: I call them ſo, becauſe we thinke them ſo: What is that? This it is; When we find out defects in our particular graces, and in particular duties, or ſome effects of particular corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; and have gone to God by Prayer, and in his Ordinances, ſo that we have a long time prayed for the filling up and inlarging of our weak faith, love, ſorrow, joy, aſſurance, and prayed againſt that hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, paſſionateneſſe, or what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever ſinfulneſſe obſerved in the heart: And yet we ſeeme to be ſtill where we were, wee creep on with the ſame impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tencies in grace, and move on with the ſame burdens of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full motions and propenſions: O now the ſoule ſits downe with much ſorrow, and with
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:58851:43"/> dolefull concluſions: Well, it is in vaine to ſeeke any more, God will make that good to me which he threatned unto <hi>Moab, Eſay 16. 12. He ſhall</hi>

               <p>The opinion of ſucceſleſneſſe muſt needs cauſe doubtings, becauſe,</p>
               <p n="1">1.

               <p n="2">2. The very ſtayes and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports of duty ſeeme to faile us. You know that the P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

He hath ſaid that hee will <hi>heare,</hi> and <hi>anſwer;</hi> Upon which aſſurance of his, we came in, and prayed, but cannot get any thing, though we preſſe God upon his owne promiſe; Whereupon the ſoule is brought to a ſtand, If God will not anſwer his owne word, how ſhall he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer me?</p>
               <p n="3">3. Now we ſuſpect not our petitions, but our perſons, and uncomfortably judge or feare, that we have been deceived in our progreſſe towards heaven: God would be to us as to his, (a God hearing Prayers) if we had been to God as his, ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving him with a perfect heart, for <hi>God heareth not ſinners, Joh.</hi>

               <p n="2">2. God is wiſe in cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing theſe ſpaces, hee hath ends, ſingular ends both for his owne glory, and for the

               <p>But thirdly, corruption takes occaſion hereby, and Satan vents his envious malice here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon: As the back-biters, and <note place="margin">Simile.</note> ſlanderers, and contentious ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, who love to ſet variance twixt faithfull friends, let the leaſt occaſion happen, a wry look, a miſplaced word, a miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intended neglect, a forbearing of preſent diſpatch in ſome deſired ſervice; let theſe fall out, preſently the back-biter, envious, malicious, contentious ſpirit, catcheth; Loe, you ſee his love, his backwardneſſe, his ſleighting of you, &amp;c.</p>

               <p>8. An eighth ſpring may <note place="margin">The eighth cauſe of doubtings.</note> be, imbecillity of judgement about the eſſentials of ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; And aſſuredly, here lies the great ſpring of doubtings. An erroneous mind is the forge which hammers all our ſuſpitions; it is the wombe which beares and breeds all our feares; If it doth not find, yet it makes all our knots for us.</p>
               <p>What one ſpeaks of a plain place of Scripture, This verſe, ſaid he, had been eaſie, had not Commentators made it ſo knotty; That we ſay of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians condition, It is gracious,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:58851:45"/> happy, cleare, ſure, did not er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneous judgements diſturbe, and vexe, and unſettle them. This is true, that a weake judgement and a tender con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience are ſeldome without feare and doubting. You ſee it in the <hi>Romans,</hi> about practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call matters, whereupon the Apoſtle preſſeth the ſtronger <hi>not to receive the weak to doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 14. 1 22.</note> 
                  <hi>diſputations;</hi> and if they had a particular faith, to keepe it unto themſelves, knowing well, how weak judgements, like weak plants, are eaſily ſtirred and ſhaken.</p>
               <p>You may ſee it alſo in the <hi>Epheſians,</hi> about doctrinall matters; for <hi>Paul</hi> giving an <hi>Item</hi> unto them to <hi>overthrow their childiſhneſſe, Eph.</hi> 4. 14. he <note place="margin">Eph. 4. 14.</note> doth paraphraſe it to be ſuch an eſtate wherein men are toſſed to and fro, and carried <note place="margin">Two things incident to this.</note> about with every wind, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Two things are incident
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:58851:46"/> unto ſhallow judgements, (by vertue of which they are obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted (with eaſe) unto doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings.</p>
               <p n="1">1. One is, They have not been converſant in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe of Truths, there be ſome Truths which yet they know not; they have not all their holds and ſtrength.</p>
               <p n="2">2. New Doctrines contrary to old Truths, are not ſo eaſily over-maſtered by their under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings, <note place="margin">A man muſt have good eyes to find out cunning gloſſes.</note> but doe either win misbelief, or elſe diſturb their true beliefe. You ſhall ſcarce heare any new things ſtarted, but withall we heare of many perſonsſtartled, as if their faith had hitherto been in vaine; for tender conſciences are apt to beleeve the moſt, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſometimes doe beleeve thoſe points which are falſe.</p>
               <p>Shall I give you inſtances <note place="margin">Inſtances.</note> amongſt our ſelves? 1. One is an equality of humiliation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:58851:46"/> converſion: as if no man were truely converted, who hath not equalled the greateſt penitent in the higheſt degrees of contrition and terror. And hence it is that many diſtreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, bowed, broken ſoules, doe exceedingly labour to grinde themſelves, and to fall into the flames of horrible fears, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to aſſure themſelves of a good eſtate: Whereas, 1. All Chriſtians are not equall in their preparations. 2. No man can judge his eſtate at all, ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, by legall humiliation.</p>
               <p>2. A full aſſurance at firſt, or elſe no faith: As if <hi>Jacobs</hi> ladder had no degrees, and the <note place="margin">Simile.</note> Sun at his firſt peeping were in the height of heaven; Or that a Scholar muſt be placed in the upper forme, as ſoone as he enters the Schoole. Such in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderate deliveries as theſe, they trouble the faith of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, (as the Apoſtle ſpeaks of
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:58851:47"/> thoſe in 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 18.) If faith cannot be without full aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, then I am no Beleever, ſaith <hi>David,</hi> for I had my fain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings; Nor I, ſaith <hi>Peter,</hi> for Chriſt himſelfe tels you, I had my doubtings.</p>
               <p>It is a moſt vaine and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous way for any Divine or ordinary Chriſtian to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe Rules, and to deliver a thing as a dogmaticall and common truth, which he or he have in a ſpeciall way onely obſerved in themſelves: The Spirit of God beſtows upon all the Elect of God, the ſame ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiall frame of grace; but the making up, and the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king out of theſe, is different: As, No man muſt ſay he hath <note place="margin">Simile.</note> no ſoule, becauſe he feels not thoſe particular workings of reaſon and deſire which ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doth; So, No man muſt conclude another to be out of the eſtate of Grace, if haply
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:58851:47"/> there be not a plenary anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rableneſſe in them both, for every method and meaſure of working grace.</p>
               <p>Therefore let me caveat a <note place="margin">An Item to the ſtronger Chriſtians</note> little here, to you who are growne Chriſtians: Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber that there are ſome who are weak, yet true members of the ſame body: and doe not you indiſcreetly inſiſt upon your onely perſonall experien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, &amp; thoſe only in ſome par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars, in all companies, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe you have (perhaps) riſen high, therefore none are right, who are below you: Conſult the Scriptures, and deliver us what it directs, and wherein it ſupports: You know not yet the aptneſſes in tender conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences to throw downe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and to catch at matters and arguments of trouble. Thou ſendeſt (perhaps) from thy company, a poore, a laden and troubled heart, with a bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:58851:48"/> and amazed opinion, that it hath now no faith, which yet came unto thee with ſome weak and ſtrong deſires of fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer faith.</p>
               <p>Weak judgements (as I ſaid before) cannot bear all things, but (like ſome mens ſtomacks) are preſently oppreſſed with meats unuſuall: And when we have miſtaken an error for truth, it may prove to the ſoule as the miſtaking of poiſon for medicine, a buſineſſe of trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome and dangerous conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence.</p>
               <p>9. Ignorance of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine <note place="margin">A ninth cauſe of doubtings.</note> of Juſtification; This is another cauſe of doubting.</p>

               <pb n="82" facs="tcp:58851:54"/>
               <p>2.

Nay, that is not all, they do ofttimes upon unjuſt grounds thruſt away the Promiſes from themſelves.</p>
               <p>And now the ſoule muſt needs be hurried with feares and doubtings, in caſe the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition be ſenſible, becauſe</p>
               <p n="1">1.

               <p>Nay, againe, the Promiſes are called <hi>the breaſts of conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:</hi> When the child is hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry, and diſtempered, nothing quiets it but the breaſts: And aſſuredly, if the Promiſes doe not ſtill the ſoule, nothing can.</p>
               <p>Now when a man will rove from this ground of faith, when he will fly from his reſt, when he refuſeth the breaſts of conſolation, no marvaile if his ſoule be full of doubts and feares: For this is all one, as if a lame man ſhould throw a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way his crutches, or a weak man his ſtaffe, or a ſick man his cordials, or a ſinking man the bough which holds him up.</p>
               <pb n="84" facs="tcp:58851:55"/>
               <p>The goodneſſe of the Lord (promiſed to <hi>David)</hi> was that <note place="margin">Pſa. 27. 13</note> which did hold up all his fain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings; and ſo all Gods people have ſtill been held and ſtaffed up by Gods Word: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that perſon muſt needs be full of doubts, who withdraws his ſhoulder from ſuch a ſtay and rock, upon which hee ſhould leane and reſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe.</p>
               <p n="2">2. This is but ſelfneſſe, which is ever accompanied with unquietneſſe: for why doſt thou refuſe to apply thoſe Promiſes which God hath made? Is it not becauſe, 1. Thou wouldſt have more goodneſſe firſt, 2. Leſſe unbeliefe firſt? And is not this a ſelf-ſeeking, yea, in ſome ſort a ſelf-ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding?

Or thus, Lord, I find much un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>evenneſſe in duty, and thou haſt promiſed to give thy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, which ſhall cauſe mee to walk in thy way, but I will not beleeve this Promiſe, untill I be firſt more enabled in duty. Or thus, Lord, I find much ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe in me, and thou haſt promiſed to change &amp; cleanſe the heart, and to ſubdue ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, but I will not beleeve this Promiſe, untill firſt I ſee my ſins ſubdued: When I find my graces increaſed, then I will beleeve that thou wilt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe them; when I find my <note place="margin">Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thou haſt done it, then I will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve that thou wilt doe it.</note> obedience continued, and my ſinnes ſubdued, then will I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve that thou wilt cauſe me to walk, and wilt ſubdue ſins. <hi>q. d.</hi> If thou wilt performe thy Promiſe before I doe beleeve
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:58851:56"/> thy Promiſe, then I will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve thy Promiſe. This is as <note place="margin">Simile.</note> if a man would ſee the blood in the veines, before the veins are opened; or waſh his hands cleane, before he hath turned the cock to let out the water.</p>
               <p n="3">3. A man is ſtill held by the powers of his corruption: And where corruptions, or wants are ſtill found in their former meaſure, there the tender ſoule will doubt and feare.</p>
               <p>Let a man beſtow himſelfe much in hearing, or much in praying, or much in confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, yet if he have the art of thruſting away the Promiſes, he will be ſtill as he was: <hi>v. g.</hi> Suppoſe a man to be ſick, call <note place="margin">Simile.</note> unto his help a Colledge of Phyſitians, let them conſult upon his eſtate, preſcribe the moſt fitting potions, &amp; quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning cordials, and when the patient hath heard them, hee efuſeth their preſcriptions, he
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:58851:56"/> will not take them, but ſaith, Theſe belong not to me; will his diſeaſe at all abate?</p>
               <p>So is it with us; when wee heare, or reade, or confer, and many Promiſes fall in to our help, if yet we put them aſide, we now keep up our ſinful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, our weakneſſes, and therefore keep up our doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings and diſtruſts.</p>
               <p>But you will ſay, All Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes <label type="milestone">

               <p>Againe, ſuppoſe thou findeſt weakneſſe of Grace, (that thou canſt not doe the good that thou wouldſt doe) doſt thou now well to thruſt away the Promiſes of aſſiſtance and ſtrengthning, by ſaying, What is that to me, if God hath ſaid, <hi>I will uphold,</hi> and <hi>I will ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then,</hi> and <hi>My grace is ſufficient,</hi> and <hi>My power ſhall be manifeſt in weakneſſe?</hi>

               <p>How can the ſoule but be greatly trouled, when it hath turned its day into night, and ſhut up that light which once it injoyed to its great comfort and ſolace? <hi>Woman, why wee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt thou?</hi> (ſaid Chriſt to <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, Joh.</hi> 20. 15.) <hi>Becauſe</hi> (ſaid ſhe) <hi>they have taken away my Lord, and I know not where they have laid him:</hi> So may we juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly weep, when our ſinnes have taken away our God from us in his comfortable favour, and we cannot eaſily regaine him, and find him.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Theſe times of ſuſpenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ordinarily are times of
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:58851:60"/> tryall: wherein God leaves the Chriſtian to ſome notable combats, and to the great ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes of Graces; at which time, corruptions and tentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons will ſtir, and therefore no marvaile if they be times mixt with ſome feares and doubtings.</p>
               <p>12. Another ſpring of doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, <note place="margin">The twelfth cauſe of doubtings.</note> is, the crediting of Satans teſtimony touching our eſtate; when we reſt upon his judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and ſee our conditions through his informations.</p>
               <p>You know that objects are diverſly repreſented unto the eye; Sometimes from them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in their proper nature, as when a man ſees a green co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour <note place="margin">Simile.</note> as it is; ſometimes medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately, by other things, as when a green colour is ſeen through a red glaſſe; now it doth not appeare in its native colour, but in the likeneſſe of that through which it is percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved:
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:58851:60"/> So is it with our ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all eſtate.</p>
               <p>Sometimes it is repreſented unto us, as it is truly exiſting; and thus we ſhall ſee it, when we look upon it, and judge of it by the word of God: And ſometimes it is repreſented unto us, not as it is, but as it appears in ſome corrupt and deceiveable teſtimonies and reports unto us: As <hi>Joſephs</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Ioſeph.</note> chaſtity appeared to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter under the nature of abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable uncleanneſſe, when he took the teſtimony of it from his filthy wife: So ſhall our moſt innocent &amp; upright frame appeare unto us to be nothing elſe but baſeſt hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſie, if we put the iſſue of it upon Satans informations: For as Satan hath an art to colour over the true condition of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full bondage, keeping cloſe &amp; in covert the proper image, or (rather) deformity of it:
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:58851:61"/> So he hath a deluſion too, in hiding from our eyes the true powers of gracious ſincerity, and fetching up to the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment all our weakneſſes and preſent imperfections, with all former knowne evils, with which he doth ſo totally poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſe the mind, that it can hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſee any thing that good is in it ſelfe, or if it doth, yet it ſees ſo much corruption and imperfection, as that it is rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy almoſt to turne the ſcale and ballance.</p>
               <p>And here our crafty enemy ceaſeth not, but taking the advantage of a tender conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, he exaggerates upon us the large diſtance of this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition in which we now are, from that which God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands and expects, and hath found in ſome of his righteous ſervants; in the citation of whoſe piety he is not very ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, that by the conſideration
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:58851:61"/> of their fulneſſe and our owne emptineſſe, wee might the more eaſily ſuſpect our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, and credit his relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
               <p>Which if we once doe, <hi>Bone Deus!</hi> into what labyrinths doe we wind our ſelves? into what fears? into what doubts? We ſhall never ſet out to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve any Promiſe, but hee checks us back with the hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowneſſe of our condition; we ſhall never ſet upon any ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance or duty, but he foyles us with ſuſpicions (at leaſt) that all is in vaine, God will not bleſſe and proſper his Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances unto ſuch; And in thoſe Ordinances, if any matter of bitterneſſe or uncomfortable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe be delivered, he brings home that to us, and tels the ſoule, This is thy portion.</p>
               <p>Now where our eſtate reſts upon a deceitfull informer, where we take things as Satan
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:58851:62"/> makes them, where we judge of ſin as he pleads it, and of Gods love to us as he conveys it, and of Gods Promiſes as he interprets them to us, and of our owne Graces, and holy temper, as he cleares and evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denceth them unto us, there can be nothing but jealouſies, feares, diſtractions, and daily doubtings in the heart.</p>
               <p>13. Another ſpring may be <note place="margin">A thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth ſpring.</note> ſome new riſings of old ſinnes after humiliation, and ſome ſingular aſſurance of their pardon.</p>
               <p>

                  <pb n="99" facs="tcp:58851:62"/> time) and now to haunt us: So theſe ſins which we have long ſince committed, and long ſince bewailed, and long ſince renounced, and after long hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliations their diſcharge hath been obtained; to meet theſe ſins (like an enemy with a ſword in his hand) with guilt in their faces and countenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces againe, this will amaze the ſoule, it will appale it, and ſtar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle it, and make us more then once to ſigh and inquire, Why is it ſo?</p>
               <p>Two things will now fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <note place="margin">Two things.</note> queſtion.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The reality of pardon: Where God ſaith, he <hi>pardons ſinne,</hi> there he ſaith, that he will <hi>remember it no more:</hi> But it ſeemes he doth remember it, (elſe how comes it thus upon me as a debt not yet diſchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, as a guilt not yet remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved?) and if he doth thus re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member it againſt me, I much
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:58851:63"/> feare, that as yet the Book is not croſſed, this ſin is not par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned. Upon which, ſomething elſe may fall in; If this ſinne be not pardoned, perhaps the reſt are not; and if this be ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen up againſt me, how can I tel but all the reſt may (afreſh) ſet themſelves in array, and give a ſecond charge upon my conſcience too?</p>
               <p n="2">2. The reality of Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance: For where God calls for ſound repentance, (as <hi>Eſay</hi>

               <pb n="101" facs="tcp:58851:63"/>
               <p>Whereupon the ſoule miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gives for its part: God will doe what he hath promiſed, <note place="margin">Note.</note> if I had done what I was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned. If my ſins had beene truly left, they had been fully diſcharged; but now I poſſeſſe them againe in their guilt, and therefore I exceedingly feare that I did overtly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge my ſelfe of them in my repentance. If Chriſt had ſlain them by his blood, or if I had drowned them by true ſorrow and repentance, they could not thus revive in their guilt, but I feare that I did onely skin over theſe ſores, which I feele now to break out, or that I laid them aſleep onely, and not dead, becauſe they awake upon me with ſuch terrour and clamour: And if ſo, then there hath been a long and fruitleſſe veine of rotten hypocriſie in me; &amp; whereas I had thought my work almoſt finiſhed, I am
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:58851:64"/> as yet to begin againe.</p>
               <p>Beloved, this is a ſecret and piercing fountaine of ſtrong fears and doubtings, eſpecially when the ſins riſe up, and ſet on us afreſh after a courſe of humiliation, and ſome ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar aſſurance of their pardon: and yet it is the caſe of many Chriſtians, incident unto them in their dayes of great loſſes, or ſickneſſes, or death.</p>

               <p>God (you know) hath ſet in our ſelves, our Law-giver, our Judge, and our Witneſſe: Conſcience doth ſuſtaine, and ſhould diſcharge the offices of all theſe: In a doubtfull day it ſhould cleare our condition, and witneſſe for us againſt the teſtimony of Satan, and of our owne feares: And therefore God hath given unto it an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſing and comforting power,

               </p>
               <p>Here conſider ſome parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars,</p>

               </list>
               <p n="1">1. There is a three-fold te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony <note place="margin">A three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony.</note> about our eſtate; 1. One is from the Spirit, which ſhines in the renewed heart by an unſpeakable light, <note place="margin">1 Cor. 2. 12</note> and manifeſts unto it the things given unto it of God, and ſo ſeals, and witneſſeth the truth and goodneſſe of our particular intereſts in God and Chriſt, according to the word of God. 2. Another is from faith, which doth teſtifie the intereſts of the ſoule in that happineſſe which it finds re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:58851:65"/> in the Word: For that which faith beleeves by a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect act in the Word, it may teſtifie of the ſame to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon by a refexive <note n="*" place="margin">By aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.</note> act. 3. A third is from Conſcience, which beholding the ſimplici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and godly ſincerity of the heart, teſtifies unto it (againſt all oppoſition) that this bleſſed frame is in the ſoule; and this teſtimony being concordant with that of the word, the ſoul is thereby greatly ſuſtained, foraſmuch as this is knowne before, <hi>viz.</hi> A ſincere temper is happy; and now Conſcience clearing that temper, the ſoule hereupon is much cheered.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Our condition falls un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a three-fold conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <note place="margin">A three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold eſtate.</note> 1. Sometimes under the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſations of Conſcience: Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience doth ſpeak and teſtifie, but it is either that our hearts are totally baſe, and ſinfull,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:58851:65"/> and corrupt, or that in ſuch and ſuch a particular it is not right, it was not perfect, but ſinfull and degenerating.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Sometimes under the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſations of Conſcience: where Conſcience teſtifies, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quits, and ſpeaks peace, either <note place="margin">As in <hi>Paul, loc. cit.</hi> As in <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> about <hi>Saul.</hi>
                  </note> about the frame of the heart, or rectitude of ſome particular action and courſe.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Sometimes under a neu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trall act or work of the Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence: <hi>(i.)</hi> The Conſcience (like <hi>Abſolom</hi> to <hi>Ammon,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 13. 22.) ſpeaks unto a perſon nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther good nor bad: It doth not accuſe him, nor doth it excuſe him; it doth not ſpeak terror, nor doth it ſpeak peace; it doth not charge any ſpeciall guilt, nor doth it give us a particular diſcharge of any.</p>
               <p>Now this is the time of fears and doubts; I will ſhew you why: becauſe,</p>
               <p n="1">1. A negative ſtate ſatisfies
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:58851:66"/> not a tender Chriſtian; It doth not ſatisfie a tender ſoule, that God looks not like an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy, unleſſe alſo he looks as a friend; or that Conſcience doth not check, but that it ſhould excuſe. It doth trouble us many times, that in our exemptions from trouble, wee yet find no Peace-ſpeaker.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It gives ſuſpicion of a neutrall eſtate: becauſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience ſeems to behave it ſelfe as a neutrall, neither againſt us, nor for us. I call that a neutrall eſtate, which is not eminently evill; it hath ſome good in it, and doth ſome good, but is not ſo good as to be gracious: therefore the civill eſtate is a neutrall; it doth not riſe to be ſo bad as the worſt, nor to be ſo good as the beſt people are. Now this eſtate (abſolutely conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered) is bad, it is an evill eſtate, it is an eſtate in which
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:58851:66"/> if a man lives and dies, (and goes not beyond it) he cannot be ſaved.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It may breed an expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation of the worſe teſtimony of Conſcience; for withdraw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are (ſometimes) the forerunners of ſome bitter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions: It fell out ill with <hi>Saul,</hi> when God withdrew himſelfe from him: So when Conſcience withdraws, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps my Conſcience hath found matter againſt me; and as it doth not now ſpeak peace, ſo (perhaps) ſhortly it may ſpeak bitter things unto me.</p>
               <p n="4">4 Nay, Conſcience is Gods Vice-gerent, it is his Deputy, and therefore in the ſilences and withdrawments of it, wee look through and feare the diſpoſition of God himſelf to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards us; becauſe the ſervants do ordinarily expreſſe the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits, and inclinations, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of their maſters: And
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:58851:67"/> this is certaine, that we doe in an angry conſcience behold <note place="margin">Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is the looking<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glaſſe.</note> alwayes an angry God, and ſo in a cheerfull conſcience a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious God, and ſo ſhall we in a ſilent conſcience ſuſpect a doubtfull God: We doe ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily judge how God is to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards us by what we find and feele Conſcience to be towards us: This is the glaſſe in which we ſee his favours or frowns.</p>
               <p>Theſe are the ſprings of Doubtings, which I have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged in their opening unto you; it is likely there may be more then theſe, (I could alſo deliver you more about the temporall eſtate; but that is out of our ſcope and compaſſe now) It now remains that I deſcend to the cloſing up of theſe ſprings, to the cures and remedies of theſe Doubtings, which is the laſt thing propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.</p>

They make the incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragements <note place="margin">By contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings and denyals.</note> of faith to be diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult; they keep off the things which would edge &amp; quicken
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:58851:70"/> our faith. As <hi>Peter</hi> ſaid in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther caſe, <hi>Depart from me Lord, for I am a ſinfull man;</hi> So the heart here, God is or will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from me, becauſe I am ſuch a ſinner; He will not hear my prayer, becauſe of my ſins; nor be gracious to me, becauſe of my ſins; nor may I pitch upon his Promiſes, becauſe of my ſins.</p>
                  <p>Now conſider, if that which did keep downe faith in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of its proper inclination, (for faith naturally bends up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward) and in reſpect of its o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration, that it cannot exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe it ſelfe without interrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, were removed; would not faith be higher? If the chain and bolts were off, if the rheume were dryed, ſhould we not walk better, ſhould we not look better? Againe, If the incouragements of faith were kept cloſe to faith, if faith could ſee them, and dwell
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:58851:70"/> upon them, would not our doubtings ſinke? Therefore it is more then evident that our doubtings would ſink, if our naturall corruption did ſinke, if our ſinfull luſts did ſinke, which doe breed thoſe indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions, thoſe interruptions, thoſe continuall difficulties un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to our faith. Faith would riſe, if its contrary did abate. <hi>Caſt</hi>

                     </label> No queſtion but doubtings would ſinke, if ſinfull corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:58851:71"/> did fall; If the fountaine did decay, the ſtreams would leſſen; But alas, 1. Who can mortifie his ſinfull nature? 2. What kind of mortifying of it is requiſite? 3. What way may be taken to effect it?</p>
                  <p>I will briefly ſay ſomething to each of theſe demands. <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Sol. </seg>
                     </label>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. To the firſt, Who can mortifie his ſinfull nature? I anſwer, Of himſelfe, no man can; naturally he hath neither will nor power thereto: But as <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> ſpake in the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſe <note place="margin">Tu non po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, ſed Dominus tuus poteſt.</note> of Repentance, Thou canſt not turn thee, but yet thy God can turn thee; That I ſay here in the buſineſſe of morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying, Thou canſt not mortifie thy ſins, but God can doe it: He can doe it for thee, though thou canſt not doe it for thy ſelfe: Though thy naturall corruption be a ſpreading le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proſie, he can heale it: Though it be a violent plague, he can
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:58851:71"/> cure it: God hath put enough in Chriſt to ſave a ſinner, and therefore enough to heale a ſinner. Remember one thing, In all commands, the duty is thine, and the power is Gods: He who commands thee to mortifie ſinne, is ready enough with ſufficient power to effect it, if he be ſought unto.</p>
                  <p>Nevertheleſſe obſerve by the way, that Mortification may be effected two wayes; 1. Paſſively, as when the Lord doth infuſe holy principles of Grace, which are contrary in their nature and vertue to the nature and power of ſin, wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king out ſinfull corruption by degrees. 2. Actively, as when the renewed and converted ſoule doth by faith ſucceſſively apply and draw down the cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifying vertues of Jeſus Chriſt; Though the meere naturall man can doe nothing to the mortification of ſinne, yet the
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:58851:72"/> renewed perſon having recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved grace from God, is by the help of Gods Spirit to ſtir up the grace that is in him, and eſpecially his faith, to truſt on Jeſus Chriſt for the further ſubduings and crucifyings of his ſinfull nature.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. But now for the ſecond demand, What kind of Morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication is moſt requiſite, ſo as in more meaſure to free the heart from doubtings? In a word, this; be ſure the morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying be</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Radicall: lay the axe to the root: As all Graces thrive moſt when their ſprings are quickned, ſo all ſinnes decay moſt when their roots are mortified. Corrupt acts will fall quickly, if a corrupt heart were more ſanctifyed. The ſtrength of ſinne is inward, there are the ſtrong holds which need moſt to be caſt downe: By all means ſet up a
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:58851:72"/> crucifying Chriſt in thy bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Impartiall. It is true, one ſin may trouble more then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, but it will be thy wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome to trouble all ſin: Sins are chained together as well as Graces; and one ſin ſerves to help another, and the neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected ſinne may perhaps ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly wound thee, and make thee to ſtagger. The whole bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of ſinne in every member of it, muſt be the object of thy mortifying work: This will teſtifie the truth of Grace re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, and the ſincerity of thy conſcience, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently will remove many bottomes of feares and doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Diurnall: <hi>(i)</hi> a daily work. Perhaps ſometimes thou art fervent in the work, (when conſcience is ſtruck, or when afflictions ſtrike thee) but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards thou art negligent,
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:58851:73"/> and then ſinne gets ſtrength againe. But as thou ſhouldſt live by faith daily, ſo thou ſhouldſt die to ſinne daily: Watch thy ſpirit, reſiſt the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it, inſiſt on divine pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, implead the ſtrength of Chriſt every day: Thou ſhouldſt ſo beleeve ſtill, as if thou never yet hadſt enough of Chriſt; and ſo live ſtill, as if thou wert to live thy laſt; and ſo mortifie ſin ſtill as thou didſt at the firſt time wherein God looked on thee.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Speciall. If thou wouldſt make thy battell ſtrong in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny part, doe it then againſt Infidelity, and whatſoever up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holds and contributes unto it. It is granted, that the Radicall principle of thy doubts is ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall ſinne; but then the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate principle of it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining Infidelity. Out of it immediately come all thy ſtaggerings, and reelings, and
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:58851:73"/> queſtionings, and doubtings: That is it (O weak beleever) which diſables thy apprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Covenant, of Chriſt, of the Promiſes, of thy Title: That is it which perverts thy judgment, and miſ-perſwades it with cunning reaſonings, ſo that either thou canſt not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne the full truth of Gods Promiſes, or thou canſt not ſee prevailing reaſons to perſwade thy ſelfe that they belong to thee.</p>
                  <p>Therefore let the main care and work of thee be, to ſtrike at unbeliefe: Be humbled much for it, beſeech the Lord to cure thee more and more of it, to remove the ignorance of the Covenant out of thee, and to caſt downe carnall and proud reaſonings, which give the lye to the way of Gods free and full Grace; which would have thee to be firſt, and of thy ſelfe, that which thou
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:58851:74"/> canſt never be without Chriſt: and to doe and bring that which God never impoſed on thee to doe or to bring, but hath told thee plainly, the working of it in thee belongs onely to himſelfe, and hee is alſo really and graciouſly wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to beſtow upon thee.</p>
                  <p>3. As for the third demand, What way thou mayſt take for the mortifying of all this ſin; I anſwer,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Generally, touching all of it, Do but inſiſt in the ways on which already thou art falne; Did any vertue in the death of Chriſt, (laid hold on by faith) did that heretofore help againſt ſinne? It will doe ſo ſtill: Did any love of God help thee the more to hate ſin? It will doe ſo ſtill: Did any aſſurance of a reconciled God in Chriſt, freely and abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly pardoning of thee, wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken ſin in thee? It will doe ſo
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:58851:74"/> ſtill: Did ſolemne confeſſions of ſin, ſelfe-judgings, ſpeciall mournings, ſufficiently help thee with conqueſt of ſinnes? They will doe ſo ſtill: Did the humble application of thy ſelf to the Ordinances of Jeſus Chriſt, (through which he is pleaſed to reveale his arme) confer any ſtrength againſt thy ſins? It will help ſtill: Did any holy feare, any tenderneſſe in conſcience, any declining of occaſions? Did vehement wreſtlings with God in Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er? Did ſerious meditation and conſideration? Did cloſe ſocie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty with the Saints? Did ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of farther holineſſe? Did frequent reviewings of thy condition, and renewings of Covenant with thy God in his ſtrength? Did holy watchings? Did reſiſtings of the firſt births of ſin? Did theſe, any of theſe, all of theſe, or any other ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall courſe beſides theſe, cauſe
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:58851:75"/> thy ſinfulneſſe to be vile unto thee, to be abhorred by thee, to be caſt downe in thy judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to be caſt out in thy af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, to be caſt off in thy life? Goe on with theſe, and ſinne will then be more and more mortified, and doubts will be more and more weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned: the more that thy conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is thus ſprinkled from dead works, the more ſhalt thou be able to draw neere unto God in aſſurance of faith.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Particularly, for the mortifying of remaining Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity, doe three things:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Study exactly the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace, in the Author of it, foundation of it, matters contained in it, and all the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juncts and termes of graciouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, ſutableneſſe, fulneſſe, faithfulneſſe, &amp;c. appertaining to it.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Study JESUS CHRIST<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     <pb n="125" facs="tcp:58851:75"/> throughly; know him diſtinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the perſon of a Mediator, and offices, and effects, and works.</p>
                  <p>Then 3. To much medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in theſe, abound in Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, that God in particular would cauſe thee by faith to ſet thy ſeale unto them: But more of this will follow in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering ſome other cauſes of doubtings.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The ſecond ſpring was weakneſſe and imperfection in faith: The cure and remedy of which, is, to perfect and ſtrengthen faith: put more ſtrength, more growth, more ripeneſſe into faith, and your doubtings will be leſſe. The <note place="margin">Simile.</note> more purely the fire burnes, the leſſe ſmoke it hath; and when the light and heat of the Sunne are greateſt, then the clouds and miſty vapours are feweſt.</p>
                  <p>Faith and Doubtings are
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:58851:76"/> like a paire of ſcales, where the waight of the one beares away the other. The Diſciples I remember prayed, <hi>Lord, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe our faith;</hi> and ſo did he of whom you heard in <hi>Mark</hi> 9. <note place="margin">Mar. 9. 24.</note> 
                     <hi>Lord, help my unbeliefe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>You will ſay, No man can <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Ob. </seg>
                     </label> deny, that if his faith had more ſtrength, then his heart ſhould have leſſe doubting; But how may that be done? How may faith be ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thened?</p>
                  <p>I anſwer, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Sol. </seg>
                     </label>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. God who gave faith, can ſtrengthen it; for every grace depends upon him, not onely for birth, but alſo for comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: his ſtrength muſt lead us on fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſtrength to ſtrength, from faith to faith; he who is the Author, is alſo the finiſher of it: And therefore if thou wouldſt have a ſtrong faith, thou ſhouldſt goe to a ſtrong God, and beg of him, <hi>Lord, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:58851:76"/> my faith;</hi> My knowledge is dim, lighten that candle, open mine eyes yet more, that I may ſee thy truths; My aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents many times ſhaking, but do thou eſtabliſh and comfirm my heart in thy truths; My embracings, applications, very trembling, and broken, and interrupted, but doe thou guide mine eye to look upon my Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, do thou guide my hand to lay hold on him, doe thou <note place="margin">Doe thou perſwade me, and I ſhall be perſwaded.</note> enable my will and affections to embrace all the goodneſſe of thy ſelfe, of thy Chriſt, of thy Word.</p>
                  <p>It is Gods method to lay in (at the firſt) weak faith, that we might beg for more faith, and give him the honour of all. Had we it ſtrong at firſt, he ſhould not heare of us; but he diſpenſeth it by degrees, that in all our gettings, and in all our victories over doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, &amp;c. his ſtrength may<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>have
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:58851:77"/> the glory. Therefore goe to God, and ſay, Lord, I would have more faith, thou wouldſt have me to perfect it, but all perfection is in thee, and I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not by my meere ſtrength ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen what thou giveſt, but thou canſt water what thou plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt; though it be ſowne a weak body, yet thou canſt make it riſe a ſtrong body; though faith at firſt be but as a graine of muſtard-ſeed, yet thoucanſt cauſe it to bloſſome, and to ſpread it ſelfe into a high meaſure: Therefore thou who alone canſt doe it, doe it for thy weak ſervant: Thou muſt take charge of thine own graces; and if thou giveſt my faith more ſtrength, my belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving will bring thee in the more glory, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The ſtudying of Chriſt and the Promiſes more, will bring more ſtrength and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection to faith. It is with the
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:58851:77"/> Chriſtian as it is with the Scholar, let the Scholar ſtudy <note place="margin">Simile.</note> more the objects of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and then his knowledge will grow to be more large; So let the Chriſtian ſtudy more the matters of faith, and his faith will riſe to be more full.</p>

<pb n="130" facs="tcp:58851:78"/> of our Saviour, how ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute they are in removing our guilt, in conquering our corruptions, in making way for us to the Father, in ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding our ſuits and requeſts; did wee know how fully hee ſtands for us, he died for us, he intercedes for us, how willing he is yet to be more applyed by us, and poſſeſſed of us, we would beleeve more, &amp; doubt leſſe.

                  </p>
                  <p>Yet take a Caution in thy ſtudying of Chriſt, ſtudy him as God reveales him, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe thy doubts will ſtick up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thee. If a man ſtudyeth his <note place="margin">Note.</note> ſins in his own way, in a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall way, he ſhall neither right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſee them, nor yet be freed from them: So if men ſtudy Chriſt their owne way, if they

                  <p n="3">3. Be in the wayes of ſtrength. There are wayes in which God doth reveale his arme; his arme is that which doth ſtrengthen us, and his arme is revealed in his Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances: for God doth not call us, nor change us, nor ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then us, nor ſave us without meanes.</p>
                  <p>He who is too good for the Ordinances, will ever be too weak in his faith.

                  <p n="1">1. Senſe is not a fit Judge of our condition; it cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port our eſtate but by what it feeles: but the ſpirituall eſtate is not alwayes under feeling; wee ſhould be good and bad, found and loſt, cheerfull and ſorrowfull, many times in one day, nay in one houre, if that ſenſe gave ſentence on our condition.</p>
                  <p>Beloved, think well on this, How can ſenſe reach unto the

                  <p>For ſenſe goes our way, and faith goes Gods way: Senſe allowes and ſets it ſelfe a time, and Faith is content to receive and take Gods times: Senſe moves upon what appears, and Faith upon what is not yet: Senſe looks downward, and Faith looks upward: Senſe doth ſuſtaine it ſelfe by ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing

                  <p>We are oft times troubled by our owne pride and folly; God ſets us a way to beleeve, and we will follow our owne way; He gives unto us his Word of Promiſe to ground our beleeving, and wee will have our ſenſe to be the ground: Of which courſe, I

                  <p>You may conſider the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periences, either in things granted and performed, or in <note place="margin">Note.</note> the manner of their perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance. Thou haſt had Gods favour, thou haſt had an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, but how did thou ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine them? was it not by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving? was it not by wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon ſome good word of Promiſe? Thy injoying of them did not prevent thy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving of the word of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, but the beleeving of that word of Promiſe did let in and bring unto thy ſoul that ſweet and gracious experience: And therefore thy experience was not the ground heretofore, nor is it now; onely thus farre it ſerves as a ſingular furtherance to faith, that that God on
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:58851:86"/> whom heretofore thou didſt beleeve, and from whom (in beleeving) thou receivedſt ſuch gracious helps and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers, will againe (he being the ſame for ever, and his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes being <hi>Yea</hi> and <hi>Amen)</hi> by further beleeving on his Word, renew his gracious goodneſſe and merciful favour unto thy ſoule.</p>
                  <p>4. A fourth ſpring was, the reſtraining of faith, the curb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it in its work, and in oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions. Now the remedy of this is, to give way unto faith; give it ſcope, let it doe its whole ſervice: As the Apoſtle ſaid of patience, <hi>Jam. 1. 4. Let</hi>

                  <p>Therefore Chriſt checks his Diſciples for their anxieties,
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:58851:86"/> for their carkings and ſolici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes, and would have them to let their faith looſe to ſee a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther who would provide, <hi>Mat.</hi>

                  <p>But for the farther help in this point, conſider,</p>
                  <p>1. In any occurrence, Faith <note place="margin">Three things. here.</note> may be our Agent, it can deale for us, becauſe, 1. Our tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall life is by faith, 2. The tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall Promiſes which reach
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:58851:87"/> over all the externall conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, are the bottome of faith: Hence it is ſaid, <hi>Hab. 2. 5. The</hi>

                  <p>Suppoſe a mans means be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to ſhrinke, his condition is drawing thin, he is neare to want, at ſuch a time this man may keep downe his doubts, and tearing thoughts, if he will give faith a ſcope to worke: <hi>I will never leave thee nor forſake thee.

                  <p>There is nothing new to God, nor difficult. Though our troubles be grievous to us, yet their deliverance is eaſie to
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:58851:88"/> God, and faith can find a har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour for every ſtorme: yea, give faith but its ſcope, it will conclude preſent helps from former deliverances; and the eſcape out of old troubles, ſhall enſure faith in the new: <hi>He who hath delivered, doth, and will ſtill deliver, 2 Cor.</hi> 1.</p>
                  <p>God doth not alter, neither <note place="margin">2 Cor. 1.</note> in his truth, nor in his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, nor in his power, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though our conditions doe va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: The temptation may be new, and affliction new, but God is ſtill the ſame, and the Promiſes the ſame, and faith can make uſe of one God to conquer twenty temptations, and one Promiſe to beare up againſt many afflictions.</p>
                  <p>2. In every occurrence there is a providence, and the iſſues depend upon it. If Satan tempts if afflictions, and croſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and loſſes, and contempts befall us, there is a Providence
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:58851:89"/> to permit them, to order them, to direct them, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraine them; and if we gave faith a ſcope to work upon that Providence, we would not be ſo full of doubts.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. For Satan, he doth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed tempt and ſuggeſt, but he cannot doe this when he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth, he muſt ask leave of God <note place="margin">But his a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions and the iſſues of them are ſubor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate and under re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint.</note> to touch <hi>Job</hi> any way: And when he doth tempt, the iſſue doth not depend upon his malice; The Lord lookes on, and ſubminiſters marvellous ſtrength, and makes his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants to pray earneſtly, and heare earneſtly, and apply his Promiſes, and will deliver.</p>
                  <p>We look upon Satan, and not upon God; we look upon <note place="margin">Note.</note> ſtrong temptations, but wee look not upon mighty aſſiſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; we conſider our owne weakneſſe, but doe not conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Gods omnipotencie; wee think how unable we are, but
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:58851:89"/> not how able God is; we find yet no deliverance, and doe not give faith its perfect worke, to beleeve that God will find a way to conquer for us. If faith did but dwell up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Gods providence in this, how he ſuffers Satan to buffet us, and how his grace is ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent for us, and how his power will be made manifeſt in weakneſſe; how he hath deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, and doth in our very reſiſtance deliver us, and hath <note place="margin">

                  <p n="2">2.

Nay, let faith work, and it will cleare all; That a good condition is not exempted from afflictions, and that though God had one Son without ſin, yet he had no Son without ſorrow.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. The promiſe of pardon <note place="margin">Three things. The par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning promiſe is excluſive, in reſpect of ſinners; but incluſive in reſpect of penitents: not all ſinners, but all repenting ſinners ſhall be pardoned.</note> is indefinite to repentance: and
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:58851:98"/> I beſeech you mark this point: God doth not ſay, I will par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don ſins ſimply, but if men re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent and forſake ſins, they ſhall have mercy.

                  <p>What is that? That is, God doth not ſay, If you repent of ſuch or ſuch ſinnes, then you ſhall have pardon; but hee ſaith ſimply and abſolutely, If you repent: So that let the ſins be never ſo great, never ſo many, yet if they be ſinnes of which thou now truely repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt, they are aſſuredly pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. <hi>Eſa. 55. 7.

                  <p>Againe, becauſe that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don is promiſed to actuall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance indefinitely, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let the ſinner be what he will, let him be a perſon who was not converted before, or let him be a perſon already converted, yet if he begins true repentance, or the other renews his true repentance, they ſhall be pardoned: And the reaſon is, becauſe it is not ſinne ſimply in ſuch an eſtate which God pardons, but it is ſinne repented of, which God doth promiſe to pardon: And therefore if an evill man, whoſe life hath been a courſe of ſins, repents and leaves his ſins, he ſhall have mercy: Or if a good man fall accidentally into ſin, upon his repentance
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:58851:99"/> he may confidently plead out Gods promiſes of pardon, for he ſhall have mercy upon his repentance, as you may ſee <hi>Prov. 28. 14. He that forſakes his ſinnes, ſhall find mercy. Ezek.</hi>

                  <p>Whence we may infer, that if God will forgive his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, he will then (upon the ſame repentance) forgive his children.

                  <p n="2">2. Chriſt is of great vertue
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:58851:99"/> ſtil, and as able to put away the ſins after converſion, as well as before: therefore is he called <hi>the ſame, yeſterday, to day, and</hi>

                     <hi>we were enemies, we were recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled to God by the death of his Son, how much more being recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled, ſhall we be ſaved by his life?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We muſt think of the pacifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation by Chriſt, of the atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, of the propitiation, of the ſatisfaction, not as confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to any one ſinne, or to any one eſtate, but in reſpect of its ſufficiency, reaching over both eſtates, and all the ſins in both. What is that? That is, the death of the Lord JESUS was not onely to reach the ſins thou didſt commit in thy un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>converted eſtate; and the reſt afterward in thy converted eſtate, thou art to ſatisfie for by thine owne power ſome
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:58851:100"/> other way. What is this but that Popiſh leaven? that ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtification? thoſe humane ſatisfactions? What is this but to divide our ſalvation twixt Chriſt and our ſelves? What is this but to reſtraine either the ſufficiencie or the efficacie of his death?</p>
                  <p>No, Chriſt is unto us in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of ſins before, and ſins af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter converſion, as the Lord was to the Iſraelites, a pillar of a cloud, and a pillar of fire. Jeſus Chriſt is a cloud in the <note place="margin">Chriſt a pillar of cloud, and a pillar of fire.</note> day, (in the time of converſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) to cover our ſins upon our repentance; and a pillar of fire by night, (for the times of former darkneſſe) upon our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance to conſume away our ſins, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>The difference of our eſtates doth no way adde or diminiſh to the ſtrength and efficacie of his death: His bloud can cry as loud now as heretofore, and
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:58851:100"/> is not leſſe effectuall to get par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don for our falls in the way, then for our ſinnings when we were not in the way, as is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent in the ſins of <hi>Paul</hi> before his converſion, and in ſins of <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Peter</hi> after their converſion: for Chriſt is our continuall Mediator, and ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>living Interceſſor.</p>
                  <p>But you will reply, Theſe <label type="milestone">

                  <p>Mercy is not ſtrange unto God, it is his nature, it is his delight, and repentance will not be hid from his eyes, if it be not hid from our hearts: He calls us to repent, and cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth us to repent, that he might ſhew us his mercy, and ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſtingneſſe of his mercy.</p>
                  <p>6. A ſixt ſpring of doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings was indiſpoſition unto or about ſpirituall duties: Whence we feare the truth of grace, which is active and live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and doubt our acceptance with God, by reaſon of our dulneſſe and deadneſſe.</p>
                  <p>For the curing of this, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That dulneſſe in holy duties is poſſibly incident to men truly ſanctified.

<pb n="178" facs="tcp:58851:102"/> ſpirituall duty is contrary un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it, it hath a ſecret a verſneſſe to holy ſervices, it cares not for holy prayer; there is not onely an indifferency whether the work be done, but a deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate diſlike, and poſitive <note place="margin">The diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence twixt a dead heart and a dull heart.</note> unwillingneſſe, or rather (a Nolition) a nillingneſſe to the ſame.

                  <p>But againe, that heart is <note place="margin">A dull heart.</note> properly termed dull, which hath in it a living ſpring, but hath not a lively operation: <hi>The Spirit is willing,</hi> (ſaid Chriſt) there the ſpring was open; <hi>but the fleſh is weake,</hi> there the operation was nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row.

                  <p>And this know, that the Chriſtian condition keeps up for truth of being, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the many pauſes, the many eclipſes, the many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpoſitions

                  <p>The greateſt actions mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged from a corrupt heart are not accepted with God: (All the ſuperfluous and abundant <note place="margin">Note.</note> gifts of the Phariſees were worthleſſe, yet the Widowes mite found acceptance) The meaneſt duties ſet forth with a perfect heart are acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by God; he will take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of them; for God looks to the heart: He eyes not ſo much thy behaviour, he liſtens not

                  <p>You remember that <hi>Simile</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Simile.</note> of the Goldſmith, who hath a skilfull eye to find out the ſmaller and neglected wayes of gold, though covered with much droſſe; and many times there is much fire and much gold, when both are hidden with duſt and cole: So is it with the Lord, he can ſent out the ſecrets of our deſires, and what we would doe is obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved and taken with him for <note place="margin">Our grones are not hid from him.</note> well done, notwithſtanding the many indiſpoſitions which cover our Altar.</p>

                  <p>As a poore begger, (ſuppoſe <note place="margin">Simile.</note> ſuch a one as <hi>Lazarus)</hi> he will lie at the gate, and knock more then once, &amp; wait more then an houre for ſome alms, for ſome crums of our tables; and ſo will humble Chriſtians, who are truly poore in ſpirit, they will be at heaven gates, and put up requeſt after re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, and expect day after day the ſpeeding of them from the throne of grace and mercy.</p>
                  <p>But we cannot wait. <note place="margin">Ob. Sol.</note>

                  <p>You cannot! And that is

                  <p>Yet let me not goe off eaſily from this ſcruple, for in it lies the choiceſt part of the cure: If we could but wait on God, then aſſuredly we ſhould ſee that we have no reaſon to cry out of fruitleſneſſe in ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king.</p>

<pb n="203" facs="tcp:58851:114"/> and wait the ſealing of it: Yet pardon of ſinnes is ſuch a thing, as our very life lies in it.</p>
                  <p>So againe, Is not grace a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular thing? Is not mortifying of ſin an excellent thing? And is it much that the Lord puts us to more frequent ſeekings, to iterated prayers and duties, for thoſe gifts and grants which are ſo high in their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture? ſo admirable in their uſe? ſo ſaving in their end? can you be better im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed?</p>

                  <p n="4">4. Doubled ſervices have uſually doubled mercies: for when God prepares the heart, he will incline the eare; and when he intends a great mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, he firſt enlargeth the heart to a greatneſſe of deſire and ſeeking.

                  <p>4. We ſhall have the beſt things in the fitteſt times: therefore we ſhould not accufe our ſervices as loſt, for God will anſwer them; but then it

                     </label> doth know that thou haſt a proud temper, and thou grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt big, and art apt to ſwell up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on enlargements: Thou art apt to deſpiſe others, and to make glorious conceits of thy ſelfe, and therefore he doth anſwer thee, not by victory, but by combat: That is, he doth not preſently ſubdue thy ſinne, that it ſhall not trouble thee, but lets it alone that it ſhall exerciſe thee, thou ſhalt find matter to keep thee low and humble, when ſtill thou feeleſt ſuch remnants and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kings of corruption. To the reſiſtance of which God doth yet enable, and after thy heart growes more emptied, thou
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:58851:116"/> ſhalt have victory. Againe, though thou prayeſt againſt thy ſins, yet thou doſt venture upon the provocations and occaſions of ſinne, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord may juſtly hold up, becauſe thou holdſt not in. Now the Lord (by his ſilence) will teach thee in theſe times, forbearance on thy part, as well as forbearance on his part; and then upon thy next prayers accompanied with this watchfulneſſe and avoidance of occaſions, he will let fall more ſtrength and power to mortifie thy ſinfull diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore let us not faint in caſe of ſuſpenſions, for God doth ſuſpend his grants to the times, when thou art fitted to receive them, and when it is fit for him to open them.</p>
                  <p>Is it ſin that thou wouldſt have ſubdued? Doe thou ſeek his ſubduing power, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all,
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:58851:116"/> decline inviting occaſions either from thy ſelfe or others, and then God will heare thee. Now thou art fitted, and now is it fit for God to help thee; but if thou wilt pray againſt the diſpoſition, and runne ſtill upon the occaſion, God will not anſwer thee.</p>
                  <p>Is it grace and eavenneſſe in duty which thou wouldeſt have? Then thou muſt uſe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer grace, and ſtick cloſe with humbleneſſe, and diligence, and reverence to the meanes, and now God will ſupply all thy wants. Untill thou haſt a more humble and doing heart, thou art not fitted for more grace. <hi>God giveth more grace to the humble,</hi> ſaith <hi>James.</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">James 4.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>I ſay, he will give thee more grace; Thou ſhalt have enough for thy condition, and enough for thy ſalvation, although thou haſt not ſuch an equall meaſure with others, whom
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:58851:117"/> God intends for more pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique uſe and ſervice, then he doth thee.</p>
                  <p>5. Gods forbearings ſhould not occaſion ceſſation, but earneſtneſſe: He is not ſilent, that we thereby ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ſpeechleſſe, but that our deſires ſhould grow more fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent.</p>
                  <p>You know that the skilfull <note place="margin">Simile.</note> Angler doth not draw back his bait that the fiſh ſhould not bite, but that by this meanes he ſhould the more greedily leap after the bait.</p>
                  <p>And the tender mother ſteps aſide, not that ſhe would not have the child ſeek her, but that it may even dote af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter her.</p>
                  <p>So doth God many times draw back and ſtep aſide, and as the Prophet <hi>Jeremie</hi> ſpeaks, <note place="margin">Jer. 11. 8.</note> 
                     <hi>He becomes as a ſtranger, and as a way-faring man who turneth aſide, &amp;c.</hi> And as <hi>David</hi> ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth,

                  <p>Now the remedy of this ſpring, conſiſts in theſe parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Get a diſtinct know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Fundamentals: It is the emptineſſe of our minds that we be prepoſterous in our ſearches. Many a Chriſtian loſeth himſelfe in a ſea of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, before he hath ſquared himſelfe with the firſt grounds of Religion.</p>
                  <p>Remember this, that the
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:58851:118"/> firſt truths doe ſupport and maintaine the reſt, (as the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner-ſtone the reſt of the buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding) and are as the originall Will, which decides many ſcruples in Law. Hence is it, <note place="margin">Simile.</note> that ſome men doubt about ſpeciall concluſions, becauſe they are ignorant of the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall principles; which were they diſtinctly knowne, the falſity of any concluſion would eaſily become evident unto them. Men uſually diſpute firſt, and know laſt: As if a <note place="margin">Simile.</note> Souldier would range an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, before he hath learned to handle his weapons. How or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary is it to heare diſputes <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Ergo,</hi> ſaith <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> 14. 1. <hi>Him that is weak in the faith, receive you, but not to doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations.</hi>
                     </note> of Originall ſin, of Predeſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, of Redemption, of Faith and Juſtification, of Aſſurance and Obedience, of the degrees of grace and duty, of the direct and abſolute way of life? &amp;c. I ſay it is ordinary to heare ſome arguing of theſe, who yet
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:58851:119"/> are ignorant of the nature of theſe. But,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Pauls</hi> method was to lay <note place="margin">Heb. 6. 1.</note> down his foundation of repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance from dead works, and of faith towards God: which if <hi>Paul</hi> thought fit to teach, I think fit for us to learne. That Ship rowls leaſt, which is well bottomed; and that houſe ſhakes leaſt, which is well founded; and that Chriſtian <note place="margin">True knowledg is as the day wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in wee walk more ſted faſtly; and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance like the night, in which we are full of feares, and often ſtumble.</note> doubts leaſt, who is well groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in the maine points of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion: For beſides this, that Primitive truths give an aime to all truths, ſo likewiſe they uncaſe all errors, and hereſies, and opinions, and arguments which come to pervert the mind another way. And ſurely when the mind obtaines an evidence by one truth for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and by truth alſo of er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour contrary unto it, it is in the leaſt hazard of doubting; for as much as doubtings or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:58851:119"/> ariſe from ſome error or miſ-apprehenſion in the minde.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Get a diſtinguiſhing knowledge of Fundamentals from Acceſſories. Every part of the houſe is not the corner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone, or the pillars: A man <note place="margin">Simile.</note> may take away much, and yet the houſe may ſtand: If you take away the painting and muſick, or ſome ſeelings and annexed poſts, yet the houſe may ſtand.</p>
                  <p>So may a Chriſtians ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, though he know not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny acceſſory truths; nay, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though hee miſtake about them; nay, although he deny them, if this denyall be not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with a proud per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſneſſe, but ariſe onely from inevidence and inability.</p>

Shall I give you an hint of ſome par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars?
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:58851:123"/> Remember then theſe Propoſitions.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Preparations to Grace are <note place="margin">Four par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars worthy of weak chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration.</note> different and unequall: All men are not prepared by the ſame degrees, or in the ſame manner for Chriſt: Convi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the naturall eſtate, and attrition, and anguiſh, and thoſe legall operations, theſe are preparations: for men muſt <hi>know</hi> their ſinfull condition, <note place="margin">Ro. 7 7, 9.

                  <p>Now thoſe legall impreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are different: Every Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leever (of ripe yeares) hath felt them, more or leſſe, yet all cannot ſay alike. Every child feeles ſomething in his birth, <note place="margin">Simile.</note> but ſome children are brought forth with more paines, and others with leſſe difficulty. <hi>Lydia</hi> was quickly delivered, but <hi>Paul</hi> lies by it ſome dayes.

                  </p>
                  <p>The Lord is pleaſed (for he is an arbitrary Agent both for the matter and manner in our ſpirituall alteration) to ſingle out ſome perſons, &amp; to charge their ſinnes deep upon their conſciences, and to purſue them with ſingular terrors, to ſtick his arrows and their own ſins ſo cloſe that they know not which way to turne them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. He doth almoſt grinde <note place="margin">Some per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</note> them to powder, and caſts them to the duſt, and to the loweſt amazements and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtractions; and then as the skilfull Artificer, who hath bruiſed, and battered, and bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the maſſe into pieces, and throwne it into the fire, and melted it, hee yet at length
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:58851:124"/> takes it out, and faſhions from all this, a moſt comely, and precious, and uſefull veſſell: So doth the Lord many times with ſome people, he returnes them their old ſinnes, and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>werfully mingles the Law and their ſinnes, and their conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences together, and ſo with that hammer bruiſeth and breaks their ſinfull hearts, and with that fire melts them and diſſolves them as it were; yet after a long and ſad time of ſenſible conviction and horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble bondage, hee graciouſly formes the Lord Jeſus in their hearts, and renewes his bleſſed image of grace, and they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the moſt acceptable veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels of glory.</p>
                  <p>But with other perſons hee deals not in this high meaſure; He doth indeed arreſt them <note place="margin">Others gently prepared.</note> with the Law, but doth not ſo fetter and iron them; he doth not ſo impriſon them, but up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

                     </item>
                  </list>
                  <p>Theſe are the ends, which being in ſome ſooner, in others later, accompliſhed, the Lord
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:58851:125"/> doth ceaſe the workings of preparation.</p>
                  <p>You know that if a piece of ſtone or wood will break with one or two blows, we ſpare the reſt; and if the maſſe will yeeld <note place="margin">Simile.</note> in one dayes firing, we then let it out: So, &amp;c. But if yet the knottineſſe be great, and reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance long, then knotty wood muſt have iterated blows, and un-yeelding metall muſt have the greater fire.</p>
                  <p>From all this, the doubtfull heart may perhaps be ſetled about his eſtate in grace: Aske him, Doſt thou love God? I doe: Serve him with all thy might in all thy wayes? I do: Reſt upon Jeſus Chriſt? I do: Combat and war againſt ſin? I doe; and yet I feare all is not right: Why? Becauſe I never had ſuch terrors as others. Now then informe thy weak judgment, If God hath ſhewn unto thee thy ſinfulneſſe, If he
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:58851:125"/> hath abated thee, and emptied thee of thy ſelf, If ſin and thou are now at defiance, If thou haſt yeelded unto the recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of Chriſt upon his owne termes and conditions, though thy legall preparations were not anſwerable to others, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for intenſion of ſtrength and meaſure, or for extenſion of length and time, yet thy condition is good and ſafe: For that humiliation which is accompanied with theſe iſſues, is aſſuredly bleſſed and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable. If the phyſick car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries away the humour, though <note place="margin">Simile.</note> it doe not make the perſon ſo ſick, yet it is good: And though a man want a ſtorme to drive him to ſhore, yet is he ſafe enough, if he be landed with a ſofter gale and tide.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The operations of Grace are alſo different and unequall, notwithſtanding that Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans may have one common
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:58851:126"/> principle, and the ſame exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall means of grace. I beſeech you obſerve this.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. There is one and the ſame (ſpecificall) ſeed of rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerating grace in all Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans; the ſame ſpirit of holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, of faith, of repentance, of love, &amp;c. All Chriſtians are bottomed alike, and rooted alike for the ſubſtantiall part of Grace.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That many Chriſtians may live under the ſame means of Grace, as many peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple doe live under the ſame light and heat of the Sun, and children under the ſame pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. That the exerciſes of their graces may yet be diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent: as children having the ſame ſchoole, may yet ſit in <note place="margin">Simile.</note> ſeverall formes; and having the ſame food, may yet have ſeverall agilities and abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</p>
                  <pb n="229" facs="tcp:58851:126"/>
                  <p>So Chriſtians, who have the ſame principles of belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, and repenting, and pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and doing, and who have the ſame miniſtery, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon aſſiſtances, may yet vary and differ in the active part of graces and duties. One may know more then another, one may reſt upon Gods Promiſes more then another, one may pray with more fervencie then another, one may do the other parts of duty more then ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, &amp;c. yet all of theſe may have truth of grace, and may be ſaved.</p>
                  <p>Therefore know, that ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quality of holy operation doth not ſpring from nullity or falſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of Grace, but ſometimes from the variety of particular <note place="margin">Inequality of holy operation, whence.</note> occaſions, ſometimes from the variety of particular ends, ſometimes from the variety of particular aſſiſtance. Every Chriſtian hath not alike,</p>
                  <pb n="230" facs="tcp:58851:127"/>
                  <p>1. Forcible occaſion to exerciſe his faith and patience:</p>
                  <p>Nor 2. doth God intend every Chriſtian for ſome ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular ends and ſervices, to which hee fits others by the greater improvement and uſe of their graces.</p>
                  <p>3. Neither hath every man at all times an equall gale or breath of ſpirituall aſſiſtance to enlighten him, to excite, and affect, and draw him. I might alſo adde,</p>
                  <p>4. Neither doth every Chriſtian ſtir up the gifts and graces in him; hee doth not wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ely on all occaſions and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions improve his ſtock.</p>
                  <p>Neither 5. hath every man alike temper &amp; conſtitution, which conduceth much to the actions of the ſoule.</p>
                  <p>6. Neither doth every cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling admit unto every Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an thoſe ſpaces, and leaſures, and remiſſions, or vacations,
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:58851:127"/> which ſome have to ſet on their heavenly frame and courſe.</p>
                  <p>It is with true Chriſtians, as with true men; Every man <note place="margin">Simile.</note> hath a ſoule, and faculty from that ſoule, and actions iſſuing out of thoſe faculties; yet eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man is not equall in the expreſſive wayes of nature: So is it with Chriſtians, all have truth of grace alike, but the exerciſe of it is different and perſonall.</p>
                  <p>3. As the actions, ſo the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of Grace are different: Compare Chriſtian with Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, it is as if you ſhould com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare <note place="margin">Branches.</note> one branch and limbe of a tree with another; where though all be ſet in one com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon root, yet their particular meaſures are more and leſſe. Or as if one did compare the Stars together, where though all be intereſted in the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly <note place="margin">Stars.</note> orbes, yet they differ
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:58851:128"/> among themſelves in reſpect <note place="margin">Sheepe.</note> of magnitude and light.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ye are the body of Chriſt,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Members.</note> (ſaith the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. <note place="margin">1 Cor. 12 27</note> 27.) <hi>and members in particular;</hi> this was a glorious and graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous condition: But then, <hi>ver.</hi> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="29"/> 29. <hi>Are all Apoſtles? are all Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets? are all teachers? are all workers of miracles? doe all ſpeake with tongues?</hi> Nay, <hi>Eph. 4. 11. He gave ſome Apoſtles,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Eph. 4. 11.</note> 
                     <hi>and ſome Prophets, and ſome Euangeliſts, and ſome Paſtors and Teachers.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now as this holds firme enough in various degrees of ſingular gifts for edification, ſo likewiſe it is as evident in thoſe ſpeciall graces for ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication: <note place="margin">As gifts for edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, ſo graces for ſanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion are different.</note> For, Are all in the fold of Chriſt, ſheep? There are ſome lambes: <hi>(Peter</hi> is commanded to feed both, <hi>Ergo</hi> there are both.) Are all in the garden of Chriſt, Cedars? There are ſome tender Vines.
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:58851:128"/> Are all in the houſhold of Chriſt, ſtrong men? There are ſome young, there are ſome babes in Chriſt too. So <hi>Heb.</hi> 5. 13. and 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2. 12, 13. <note place="margin">1 Joh. 2. 12, 13.</note> 
                     <hi>I write unto you, little children, becauſe your ſinnes are forgiven you, and becauſe you have knowne the Father.</hi> You ſee little chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren there, as well as young men and fathers; and theſe children, though children, though little children, though very tender Chriſtians, yet they know the Father, and they had pardon of ſin.</p>
                  <p>Brethren, how exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly doe we diſturbe our ſelves with doubtings here? Many people, through a weakneſſe (I ſay no more) of judgement, doe fall out with their eſtate and condition, moleſt and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict their hearts, cloſe up all againſt themſelves, ſuſpect, and fooliſhly reaſon and argue the nullity of a gracious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:58851:129"/> from the imperfections which they obſerve in their graces, from their behind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in faith, and zeale, and ſorrow, &amp;c. Ah ignorant peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple! who are truly induſtrious after the great meaſures of Grace, and will not yet quiet their feares, and ſtill their <note place="margin">Note.</note> doubtings with this,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That ſuch earneſt pant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and inquietations, and unſatisfiableneſſes cannot but ſpring from truth of grace.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Then, that where grace is in truth, though in the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt meaſure, there the ſoule hath intereſt in Chriſt, in all the Promiſes, in God, in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, in all.</p>
                  <p>Remember this, He who hath leaſt in grace, hath not that which he would have; and hee who hath moſt in grace, hath not that which he ſhould have; and he who hath any truth of grace, hath e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:58851:129"/> to change his heart, and ſave his ſoule. I would beleeve in that fulneſſe of aſſurance and reliance as thou doſt, and if I cannot, I will yet yet beleeve as well as I can. He who ſaid, <hi>O woman, great is thy faith,</hi> ſaid alſo to another, not ſo ſtrong, <hi>Thy faith hath ſaved thee.</hi> No man miſſeth of heaven for want of meaſure, but of truth. Our conſolation lies much in the comparative degree, but our ſalvation is in the poſitive: Much grace will yeeld unto us here our heaven, and any grace, if true, will yeeld us hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven hereafter.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The ſeparable fruits of true grace are different, not only if you compare one Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian with another, but if you compare the ſame Chriſtian with himſelfe in divers times and occurrences.</p>

                  <p>Now it is the Lord himſelfe who doth blot out tranſgreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; he doth it, who onely hath power of life and death, of condemning or abſolving.</p>

<pb n="256" facs="tcp:58851:139"/> of all ſatisfying pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments: Why elſe doth the Apoſtle ſay, <hi>Gal. 3. 13.

                  <p>Nay, let me ſpeak a bold truth; To have ſinne remitted, and yet to be expoſed to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, (I ſpeak onely of ſatisfying puniſhment) cannot ſtand with that unſpotted ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice of God; for no man is juſtly puniſhed but by reaſon of unſatisfied guilt. <hi>(In peccato fundatur reatus poena,</hi> ſaith <hi>Aqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nas</hi> well.) Now if Chriſt hath fully and perfectly ſatisfied for
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:58851:139"/> the guilt, then puniſhment hath no ground, unleſſe wee will ſay that God will puniſh for that which is already ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied; or that Chriſts ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is not totall, but partiall, <hi>(i.)</hi> he ſatisfied for a part, and left ſome parts of ſatisfying puniſhment to us, which is the opinion of the Papiſts for their humane ſatisfactions.</p>
                  <p>But to draw up again; What a comfortable ſtay and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port is this unto a diſtreſſed ſoule, to ſee and find all in Chriſt? When a perſon brought to the true ſight and ſenſe of ſin, and loathing and forſaking of it, and to the giving of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe up unto Chriſt, ſhall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold his many fore-paſt guilts, and ſee theſe charged upon Chriſt, nay and diſcharged by Chriſt, nay and ſo diſcharged that they ſhall never be char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged upon him againe, nay and all the conſequents of guilt
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:58851:140"/> removed, ſo that Chriſt hath ſet him at liberty, he hath made him a freeman, and that againſt all Satans accuſations: He may hold out the bloud of Chriſt, which will anſwer all; I am a ſinner, but <hi>Chriſt was made ſin for me;</hi> I deſerve dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, but <hi>Chriſt was made a curſe for me.</hi> If Beleevers did skill the nature, and extent, and vertues of remiſſion by the bloud of Chriſt; if they did know, and were poſſeſſed more with this part of Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, they would ſtrengthen their faith and their comfort more, and their doubtings and fears would ſink more. <hi>Be of good comfort, thy ſins are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given thee.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. One thing more, which I had almoſt forgotten, falls in, which is this, That the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiall part of Juſtification is alike to all Beleevers. What is that? It is this, God for the
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:58851:140"/> bloud of Chriſt doth not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly charge the ſins of ſtrong be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers on Chriſt, but of weak beleevers too; and theſe onely are not diſcharged, but thoſe alſo. True faith in any degree may take out all the benefits of Juſtification. For as Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation doth not admit of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, no more is it made over to the degrees, but to the truth of faith: So that not onely <hi>Abraham,</hi> the father of the faithfull, who was ſtrong in faith, but the father of the child, who cryed out with tears, <hi>I beleeve, help mine unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe,</hi> he alſo hath all the reall intereſts, the very ſame reall intereſts in the bloud of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>You know the arme hath not an intereſt in the head and influences thereof, becauſe it is big, or becauſe it is ſtrong, but becauſe it is a member, by reaſon whereof the leaſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="260" facs="tcp:58851:141"/> and weakeſt member doth alſo claime and hath a ſhare. So becauſe every Beleever by true faith is made a member of Chriſt, he hath therefore a concurrent ſhare in the bloud of Chriſt, in the Juſtification purchaſed by Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>And therefore it is a weaker argument of weak beleevers to deny, or doubt their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge by Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>True, ſay they, Chriſt is a <label type="milestone">

                  <p>And thus have I briefly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:58851:141"/> you with ſome notions about that part of Juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which reſpects our ſinnes; there is yet another part, which reſpects our graces and duties: from the weakneſſe and mixture of which, do ariſe many doubtings, and ſuch as are not to be diſputed downe by any thing in our ſelves, but onely to be anſwered with the doctrine of Juſtification.</p>
                  <p>O, ſaith the humbled ſinner, <label type="milestone">

                  <p>Let me ſtop the complaint, <label type="milestone">

                     </label> &amp; cloſe up the doubtings with a little more inlargement of the doctrine of Juſtification: Therefore remember,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Our perſons ſtand not before God in their own righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe, nor our owne ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices in their owne ſtrength. Indeed the Lord requires ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe in our natures, and holy duties from us; we are his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, we are his people, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we ſhould be holy as our Father is holy, therefore the people of his paſture ſhould ſerve him. An unholy Belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver were a monſter upon earth, and an undutifull ſon is a plain unbeleever; for though Chriſt did die for thoſe who were
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:58851:142"/> once rebellious, yet he dies for none to make them licenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous: So that holineſſe, inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent grace is abſolutely requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to ſalvation.</p>
                  <p>To ſalvation I ſay,</p>
                  <p>But to Juſtification in no wiſe. What is that? That is, though a man cannot be ſaved without inherent holineſſe, yet is he not juſtified by it; When he comes to account it with God, he may not ſay this, Lord, loe, here I am, ſee if there be any ſin in my perſon, or defect in my holineſſe; I have not offended thee, I need not any help, any mercy; my heart is totally cleane, and my duties performed at all times in every reſpect for matter and manner to the full as thou re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireſt: Enter into judgment with me if thou pleafeſt, I will be tryed by my owne ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe.</p>

I anſwer, Chriſts righteouſneſſe is full, his coat was ſeamleſſe; ours is made up, and ſtrangely cut, but his righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe is compleat, and <hi>He is made unto us righteouſneſſe,</hi> yea, and that <hi>of God, 1 Cor.</hi> 1. 30. God hath ſet him out to be our righteouſneſſe, and he juſtifies us by it.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Though our ſervices be weak, yet we are juſtified by Chriſts righteouſneſſe: <hi>Aaron</hi> was to <hi>beare the iniquity of the holy offerings, Exo.</hi> 28. 38. Their holy offerings had ſome unho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly mixtures; but <hi>Aaron</hi> was to beare them, <hi>(i.)</hi> he was to take the iniquities away from

                  <p>Chriſt is this <hi>Aaron,</hi> who by his righteouſneſſe covers all the blemiſhes, makes up all the weakneſſes in holy duties.</p>
                  <p>Therefore my brethren, in all our approaches to God, wee ſhould not doubt. It is the Apoſtles own argument, <hi>Heb. 10. 21. Having ſuch an High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prieſt over the houſe of God, 22. Let us draw near with a true heart, in full aſſurance of faith.</hi> And <hi>ver. 23. Let us hold faſt the profeſſion of our faith without wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering, &amp;c.</hi> It is as if the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle had ſaid, If men did know what a Chriſt they have, what a full righteouſneſſe there is in him, what he doth with it, how he juſtifies their perſons, and juſtifies their ſervices, pleads for them, beautifies them, ingratiates them with the Father, they would not doubt ſo much as they doe,
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:58851:144"/> they would be better perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of God, when they come and pray unto him.</p>
                  <p>I remember the Apoſtle hath an excellent phraſe in <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 24. that <hi>Chriſt doth ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare for us.</hi> It is a Metaphor from a Lawyer; If a man hath a caſe, he goes to his Lawyer, and reports all to him, deſires him to undertake the whole buſineſſe, and upon the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting of the Caſe to him, he appeares for his Plaintiffe, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens the Caſe, pleads for him before the Judge, and the Cauſe is carryed: So is it with Chriſt, he appears for us, <hi>(i.)</hi> When a poore ſinner, a weak beleever comes to him, and opens his condition, his wants, his infirmities, Chriſt under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes for him, he pleads for him, (he ever lives to make in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſion) he moves his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in his behalfe, brings out his righteouſneſſe, his bloud,
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:58851:145"/> and merits, and what he did and ſuffered for him, &amp;c. And thus doth Chriſt for every particular ſervice, duty, and prayer for him who beleeves on him.</p>
                  <p>The tenth cauſe of doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, was, diſputation againſt the Promiſes.</p>
                  <p>O, ſaith the troubled and fearfull ſoule, all theſe promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes which you produce and apply to my condition, they are nothing to me; they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long not to me: There is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed goodneſſe, and truth, a wonderfull worth in them, and they ſuit with my condition exactly, but I may not lay hold on them; I ſhould but preſume to take the bread which belongs to children, but not to dogs, not to ſuch a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as I am.</p>
                  <p>Good Chriſtian, doe but track thine owne ſpirit, or the ſpirit of any diſtreſſed in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience,
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:58851:145"/> thou ſhalt find this to be the laſt hold uſually of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beliefe, namely, a reaſoning againſt Gods Promiſes; the which reaſoning is ſometimes through meere tenderneſſe of ſpirit: as when the ſoule hath arguments to it ſelfe of that force, to repreſent a preſent incapacity of any good which God hath promiſed, and till they be removed, it dares not lay hold on the Promiſes; but if they could be ſatisfied, then it is drawne in to beleeve: But ſometimes there is a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning againſt the Promiſes, through wilfulneſſe of ſpirit, as when all the arguments of a doubting ſinner are ſo clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reſolved and anſwered by the expreſſe words of God, that the perſon cannot gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſay it; yet the perſon rather bends ſtill againſt the Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, then labours to honour God in them by beleeving.
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:58851:146"/> This later reaſoning is an irra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall way, and unworthy of our abetting: I ſhould think ſuch a Chriſtians doubtings to ariſe rather from a fixed and heavy melancholy, then any other ſpeciall cauſe. Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, ſomewhat to help the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Chriſtian, who argues &amp; reaſoneth againſt the Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, meerly out of tenderneſſe and feare of his right and title, I would commend a few things to his conſideration.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. No ſpirituall good is fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered, nor evill weakned by keeping the ſoule and Gods Promiſes aſunder. Tell me ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly, Is not all our help for ſould and body (in the full and whole latitude of it) couched in Gods Promiſes? Are they not our wells of ſalvation, and breaſts of conſolation, our ſun and ſhield? and what veſſell hath a poore ſinner to draw with out of thoſe wells? what
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:58851:146"/> mouth hath he to milk out thoſe breaſts but faith? It is faith which knits the Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and our conditions toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; it is faith which makes them to meet each other; And till the Promiſes meet (in their vertue and influence) with this condition of thy ſoule, thou ſhalt never be hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped or bettered by them: Till the plaiſter and the wound doe meet, it will never be an hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping nor healing plaiſter. Thou ſhalt be <hi>(utieras)</hi> as thou waſt, and the Promiſe ſhall be <hi>(ubi erat)</hi> where it was, it ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver do thee good till thou doſt apply it.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It is beleeving which muſt cleare our title. O, ſaith the Chriſtian, if I knew that the Promiſes belonged unto me, I would then beleeve. I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer.</p>

                  <p>But ſecondly, if ever you would cleare your title to the Promiſes, you muſt then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve; for it is faith which doth intitle you, and gives you intereſt and propriety. As the Apoſtle ſpake of a great good, <hi>After ye beleeved, ye were ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with the holy ſpirit of promiſe, Epheſ.</hi> 1. 13. that I ſay in this caſe; I fever you would be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded that God ſeales his Promiſes unto you, then doe you firſt put your ſeal unto the Promiſes: Beleeve, and then thou ſhalt ſee the good of them to be thy good.</p>

                     <hi>deadneſſe of Sarahs wombe;</hi> but he conſidered him who had promiſed, and was perſwaded that what he <hi>had promiſed,</hi> hee <note place="margin">ver. 21.</note> was able alſo <hi>to performe.</hi> Why? This is the right courſe to eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:58851:148"/> or draw out our belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving: We muſt not conſider our ſelves, but we muſt conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him who promiſeth: Our reaſons of beleeving muſt be found in him alone on whom we are to beleeve.</p>
                  <p>Therefore I beſeech you to remember, that the Promiſes of God are not onely objects of faith, but they are alſo grounds of beleeving: They doe not onely containe excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent good for us, but likewiſe the motives to beleeve that good. Beſides the goodneſſe in them which reſpectively an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers our conditions, and the preſenting of that goodneſſe unto us by way of gift, there is all reaſon conjoyned with theſe to affect our hearts to lay hold on them, namely,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. A graciouſneſſe, that the Lord will freely and for his owne ſake doe us all that good.</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <pb n="275" facs="tcp:58851:148"/>2. A fidelity, that the Lord who hath graciouſly promiſed, will alſo faithfully performe.</p>
                  <p>And 3. ſufficiencie of power in God to make good unto us whatſoever word of goodneſſe, is gone out of his lips.</p>
                  <p>So that from all theſe, a Chriſtian againſt all his doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings may yet ſee ground to beleeve the Promiſes of God, becauſe,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The Promiſes are the Declarations of God for good unto us.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. They are willing Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, ariſing onely from the good will of our God.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. He diſpenſeth the good in them to ſinners freely, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any worthineſſe or deſert on their parts.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. There is not any good promiſed, which God is not willing or able to make good.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, let any perſon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve on them, and he ſhall
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:58851:149"/> confeſſe that faithfull is that God who promiſed, and that that God who hath promiſed cannot lye.</p>
                  <p>But now on the contrary, If you look for grounds of belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving in and from your ſelves, it cannot be that ever your hearts ſhould be free from doubtings; If either you make your owne worthineſſe the cauſe of beleeving, you ſhall never come to beleeve: This were not to receive good from God, but to buy and purchaſe it; and is abſolutely againſt the nature of free promiſes, as alſo againſt the diſpoſition of true faith, which empties us of our ſelves, and ſeeth the cauſe of all our good to be on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in him who is All-good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</p>
                  <p>Or if you think that you muſt firſt finde the good in your ſelves which ye are to fetch from the Promiſes, you
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:58851:149"/> cannot then beleeve, you muſt unavoidably doubt ſtill: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is impoſſible for a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner or a needy Chriſtian ever to draw his helps out of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, or to prevent the promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of God. As he cannot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve any good from God pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing, ſo he cannot bring any good to Gods promiſes. <hi>Ho,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Eſa. 55. 1.</note> 
                     <hi>every one that thirſteth, come ye to the waters,</hi> ſaith the Prophet, <hi>and he that hath no money: Come ye, buy and eat. yea come, buy wine and milk without money and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out price.</hi> If thou be a thirſty perſon, here is all proviſion freely for thee.</p>
                  <p>4. Another thing which I would commend alſo to doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Chriſtians in this caſe, ſhall be this: Take ſome ſolid paines to cleare your entrance into Covenant with God: thereby you ſhall cleare your intereſt in all particular pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes upon your occaſions.</p>
                  <pb n="278" facs="tcp:58851:150"/>
                  <p>There is a gracious Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant <note place="margin">Jer. 31. 33 32. 38 Eze. 36. 28 Hoſ. 2. 23. Heb. 8. 10.</note> (ſpoken of in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture) twixt God and his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: He makes us to be his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and we take him to be our God. And when that Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant is paſſed twixt God and a perſon, that there is a mutuall acceptation; then the Lord eſtates this perſon into all the particular promiſes: As when the woman and man enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the covenant of mariage, now all is ſetled on her, and ſhe hath title ſufficient.</p>
                  <p>So when the Lord God and a ſinner are married to each other, when they are entred into a Covenant, Thou art my God, and none elſe, my heart is thine, my life ſhall be thine, &amp;c. The Lord ſaith unto ſuch a one, And I am thine, &amp; all my mercy is thine, my Chriſt is thine, my Promiſes thine: If thou needeſt any good for ſoul or body, all good is thine.</p>

                  <p>5. Laſtly, conſider well, whether there be nothing in a Chriſt which may not be able to over-argue thy diſputes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt thy applying of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes I remember that <hi>Luther</hi> in his Commentary on <hi>Geneſis</hi> preſcribes unto tempted per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons one very compendious way to withſtand all tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions whatſoever: Let Satan <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Luthers</hi> ſpeech.</note> come any way, or the world any way, or ſinne move any way, doe thou anſwer all with this onely, <hi>Chriſtianus ſum,</hi> I am a Chriſtian; I may not
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:58851:151"/> yeeld to any ſin, for I am a Chriſtian. And ſurely me thinks this alſo might be a compendious way to reſolve the doubtings of a Chriſtian, <hi>Chriſtum habeo</hi> I have a Chriſt. O Chriſtian, if thou didſt look more on thy Chriſt, thou mightſt look more on the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes: When wilt thou re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, <note place="margin">No look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the Promiſes without a Chriſt.</note> that as there is no comfortable looking on God without a Chriſt, ſo there will be no confident looking on the Promiſes of God without a Chriſt?</p>
                  <p>Chriſt Jeſus is thy <hi>Jacobs</hi> ladder, thy prayers get up by him, and Gods Promiſes come down by him: <hi>All the promiſes of God are Yea and Amen in him, 2 Cor.</hi>

                  <p>There was a Book in the Revelation which none of the Elders and Worthies could open, but yet the Lambe could open it: The Promiſes are a
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:58851:151"/> precious Book, every leafe drops myrrhe and mercy, yet the weak Chriſtian cannot open it, nay he is afraid to open it, and to reade his por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion there: Nevertheleſſe thy Chriſt can open the Promiſes for thee, and by thy Chriſt as thou mayſt find a way for hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven hereafter, ſo mayſt thou eſpie a way for thy comfort now.</p>
                  <p>And why, may Chriſt reply to the doubting Chriſtian, art thou afraid to beleeve? to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve my Fathers word, and thy Fathers word? Did he ever faile any who truſted on him? Is hee not willing to give, who was willing to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe? Should he loſe of his glory, if thou receivedſt of his grace? Or ſhouldſt thou loſe of thy comfort, if thou ſhouldſt beleeve in his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe? Doſt thou not care for his good? Why then art thou
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:58851:152"/> troubled? Or in good earneſt, Wouldſt thou enjoy that good? Why then doſt thou not beleeve? Thou ſeeſt the worth of the commodity, but ſtickeſt at the price. Did my Father ever ſell grace or mercy to any upon the price of their owne worthineſſe? How canſt thou imagine him to anſwer thee in juſtice, who yet deales with thee upon promiſes? And if worthineſſe muſt be found, tell me, Who am I? Is a Chriſt of no worthineſſe to thee? or of no worth with his Father and thine? I have dyed for thy ſoule, I have reconciled thy perſon, I have made God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to be thine, and therefore his Promiſes to be thine.</p>
                  <p>If thou thinkeſt that God will ſtart from his word, O thou erreſt: His Promiſe is made with Goodneſſe, is ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with Truth, and is ratified with my bloud.</p>
                  <pb n="283" facs="tcp:58851:152"/>
                  <p>If thou thinkeſt it is an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>exorable and deafe eare to thy prayers, yet conſider, it is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes an open and plyable eare to my merits. Come, then, I once gave my ſelfe for thee, and ſince that I have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven my ſelfe to thee, Be not afraid, O thou of little faith: Look on me, and through me unto a God, ſo ſhalt thou ſee him fully gracious and merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and holding forth the gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Scepter to thee. Look on me and through me unto the Promiſes, then ſhalt thou ſee them to be my purchaſe, and thy portion. Lay hold on them by faith, and inrich thy ſelfe with them, in ſo doing thou ſhalt pleaſe my Father, plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure thy ſelfe, and honour thy Saviour.</p>
                  <p>11. The eleventh ſpring of doubtings, was, the ſuſpenſion of divine favour. <hi>Thou didſt hide thy face, and I was troubled,</hi>
                     <pb n="284" facs="tcp:58851:153"/> ſaid <hi>David.</hi> O, the hiding of Gods favour is more then the hiding of the Sun, or then the withdrawments of <hi>David</hi> from <hi>Abſolom:</hi> It is even the time of our fainting, the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtration of our ſoules and life. <hi>Thy favour is life,</hi> ſaith <hi>David</hi> againe.</p>
                  <p>Here now conſider,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. In theſe times of ſeque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration, a man hath juſt cauſe of trouble; he ſhould be mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved at it, that he cannot be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold his God in that graciouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe as before, in that loving<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, in that light of his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance. And verily there is not a Chriſtian really ſenſible of the divine favour, who ſhould not be as much perple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xed in the clouding of it, as he was affected and gladded in the riſing and diſcovering of it.</p>
                  <p>Beloved, it is ill with that man who can equally beare
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:58851:153"/> up in the abſence, as in the conceived preſence of Gods favour; who is of that hard and unperceiving temper, as not to ſolace his ſoul in finding God to be gracious; and not to be abundantly diſturbed in not apprehending the wonted manifeſtations of his loving favour. How exceſſively di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſed is the Church in the Canticles, that her Beloved had withdrawn himſelf! And <hi>David</hi> doth in the violence of his diſtemper and jealouſie, (whether culpably, I know not yet) ſtrongly charge God (ſure with much heavineſs of heart) that he had forgotten to be gracious.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Nevertheleſſe in the times of ſuch ſuſpenſion, it is an error, and a dangerous er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, a fruitleſſe error, abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to conclude againſt our God, or againſt our ſelves, of any preſent or hopeful intereſt
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:58851:154"/> in his bleſſed favour: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore remember theſe parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars.</p>
                  <p>1. Obſerve the wayes and times of the interception of divine favour. This is certain, that God hath ever ſome ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall end in the holding up of his countenance; and we may and doe many times give him juſt cauſe and reaſon. In Scripture we may obſerve on our part ordinarily two occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Some groſſe ſins, which indeed are as a thick cloud to hold up the bleſſed light of Gods countenance, for he is of purer eyes then to behold ſin. Theſe are the wall of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration, theſe ſhut the doore, and draw the curtaines, and doe like ſome cloſing rheume fall upon the eye, and indiſpoſe it to the comfortable enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the light: As we may ſee in <hi>Davids</hi> two great ſinnes
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:58851:154"/> of Adultery and Murder, they did ſuſpend the preſence, <hi>(i.)</hi> the comfortable preſence of God, and held up the joy of his ſalvation, which he did ſo earneſtly deſire to be reſtored, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51. 11, 12.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Remiſneſſe and careleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in our eſteems and affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions towards him in his Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances. When Chriſtians come to a moderation, to a cooling of their ſpirituall fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, to a more negligent ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with God, and a more in different performance of holy ſervices and duties; then the Lord holds back, and calls in the ſenſible light of his countenance: As a father doth alter the ſet of his looks to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his child, who is wanton upon his love, and lets downe the diligence of his juſt obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance and duty.</p>
                  <p>See this in <hi>Cant. 5. 2. Open to me</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>my ſiſter, my
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:58851:155"/> love, my dove, my undefiled.</hi> Here was a gracious entreaty, and full of wooing compellations: What doth the Church now? Surely ſhe ſtirs, ſhe riſeth, ſhe runneth, ſhe eaſily embraceth theſe calls of Chriſt; No, <hi>ver. 3. I have put off my coat, how ſhall I put it on? I have waſhed my feet, how ſhall I defile them?</hi> What is this? She was care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, negligent, full of excuſes, ſo thoſe phraſes import, of put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting off the coat: For as the keeping on of cloathes was a ſign of care and watchfulneſſe, <hi>[Nehem.</hi> 4. 23.] ſo the putting them off was a ſigne of drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zineſſe, of a diſpoſition prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for ſleep or reſt: Nay (ſhe had waſhed her feet) which was another ſigne of her ſleepy and negligent diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; It being the manner in thoſe hot countries (where or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily they went bare-foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) to waſh their feet after
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:58851:155"/> their travel, &amp; ſo prepare the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves-to reſt. The meaning of all which, is this: She made many pretences and delayes; all which did ſpring from an acquired ſluggiſhneſſe and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſneſſe of ſpirit.</p>
                  <p>Now mark the iſſue, Though the Church did not riſe to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, yet Chriſt, <hi>ver.</hi> 4. puts in his hand at the hole of the doore: <hi>(i.)</hi> Though ſhe had neglected him in his Miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, yet he ſent into her heart a notable <hi>item</hi> of it by his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and then her bowels were moved for him. Why? What is the matter? Now <hi>ſhe roſe, ver. 5. and opened the doore, ver. 6. but my Beloved had withdrawn himſelfe, and was gone; I ſought him, but could not find him; I called him, but he gave me no an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Here you ſee, that careleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of duty cauſeth abſence of favour: And when men are
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:58851:156"/> negligent in the entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the meanes of grace, God doth in a juſt wiſdome go off with the ſenſible preſence of his gracious favour.</p>
                  <p>2. Obſerve the wayes of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaining Gods favour ſuſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded from us: What are thoſe? will you ſay.</p>
                  <p>I anſwer,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Be affected for the loſſe: every abſence of Gods coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance ſhould trouble us, but the loſſe of his favour, that ſhould grieve us. So was it with the Church there, <hi>Cant. 5. 4. My bowels were troubled for him,</hi> Or, My bowels ſoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, rumbled, made a trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blous noiſe. What doe theſe words intimate but an emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent diſquietneſſe, an hearty ſorrow for ſo great a loſſe, ſpringing from ſo great a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſneſſe? I ſay an eminent diſquietneſſe; For where bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wels are mentioned, there an
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:58851:156"/> eminent degree is ſuggeſted, either of commiſeration, as in that of God to <hi>Ephraim, Jer.</hi> 31. 20. or of ſingular love and affection, as of the mother to the child, or of moſt ſorrowfull affliction, as here.</p>
                  <p>Nay, ſo great was this ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row and bewaylment, that <hi>ver.</hi> 6. her ſould failed when he ſpake: <hi>My ſoule failed (i.)</hi> my ſoule went forth, it was gone, it departed, becauſe of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture of Chriſts loving fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour: For as the heart is ſaid to goe forth when men are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoniſhed with feare, ſo the ſoule is ſaid to goe away, when men are ſurcharged with griefe and ſorrow. Whence it is evident, that the Church was almoſt dead for her folly and negligence, whereby ſhe had cauſed her Chriſt to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw himſelfe.</p>
                  <p>And ſurely if negligent and regardleſſe entertainments of
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:58851:157"/> God, or Chriſt, or his Word, (which cauſe the ceſſation of favour) are thus abundantly bewayled with bowels and faintings, how much more ſhould the bowels be doubled, and the meaſures of griefe and repentance be ſwelled, when the ſuſpenſion of Gods love and favour is cauſed by our injurious handling of his bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Spirit, by fighting againſt his motions, and preſuming a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the directing and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing light, to diſhonour and grieve him with the moſt foule iniquities.</p>
                  <p>Yet if we can humbly and throughly bemoane our loſſe, and repent of our ſins, we ſhall behold the Lord in mercy and love againe. <hi>David</hi> could not but yeeld out the countenance of his favour to <hi>Abſolom,</hi> though an untoward ſonne: If the clouds did break, the ſunne would ſhine againe; for
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:58851:157"/> God will not onely give, but reſtore comforts to his mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Revive thy uprightneſſe, and then God will renew his favour. <hi>A good man</hi> (ſaith <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon, Prov.</hi> 12. 2.) <hi>obtaineth fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of the Lord: (i.)</hi> An up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right man, a man whoſe heart is ſingle, (for he is oppoſed to the man of many devices) whoſe heart is ſingle and plain with God in his walkings, ſuch a man ſhall obtaine favour from the Lord.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>David</hi> aſſures us of it, <hi>Pſ. 5. 12 Thou Lord wilt bleſſe the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and with favour wilt thou compaſſe him as with a ſhield.</hi> It was a good ſpeech of <hi>Davids, Pſal. 36. 9.

                  <p>For, brethren, we cannot ſee light by darkneſſe, light muſt be ſeene by light; and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever <note place="margin">Pſal. 17. 15 <hi>I will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold thy face in up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightneſſe.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. When you ſeek the light <note place="margin">Two things to be remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred in our ſeeking of Gods fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour.</note> of Gods countenance, doe not blind your eyes: Remember ſtill, that a man who will ſhut his eye, ſhall hardly find: Now nothing can ſee Gods favour but the eye of faith, for in Chriſt Jeſus onely we ſee and diſcerne him our gracious God and Father; Therefore keep open that eye. The direct wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kings of faith can alwayes ſee God, and the reflexive will at length ſee God to be my God. When thou commeſt unto him thus, Lord, I doe need, I doe prize, I doe deſire thy fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour and countenance, and thou haſt promiſed it, but thou wilt not keep thy promiſe,
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:58851:161"/> thou wilt never ſhew the light of thy countenance to my ſoul more; now though wee ſeek much, no marvaile we find not the heavens to open; You muſt <note place="margin">Simile.</note> uſe the key, as well as the hands, if you will come in and ſee the roomes: Our hands of Prayer muſt uſe the key of Faith, if we would open the countenance of God towards us; for faith is that which gives us our ſights of God and Chriſt.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Judge not of the iſſue by what thou feeleſt, but by what God promiſeth: And in caſe therefore that God doth not ſhew thee his ancient love preſently or eaſily, yet knock againe, and provoke thy heart to out-beleeve all reaſonings offeare and corruption.</p>

                  <p>12. A twelfth ſpring of doubtings, was, the crediting of Satans teſtimony about our ſpirituall condition, and inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts in God and Chriſt; to which if any diſtreſſed Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian doth hearken and attend, he ſhal never be freed from in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quietations and rowlings of mind, becauſe Satans teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny is ever directly or oblique<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:58851:164"/> againſt the truth and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of our ſpirituall eſtate.</p>
                  <p>For the remedy and cure of which ſpring, be pleaſed ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly to conſider of theſe ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent concluſions.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The finall tryall of our eternall eſtate doth immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately and ſolely appertaine to the Court of heaven. Indeed the diſquiſitive part belongs to <note place="margin">A twofold tryall of a mans eſtate.</note> us, but the deciſive part be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to God: We ought to ſearch and prove our ſelves, but no man hath immediate power to decide his eſtate, by acquitting or condemning himſelfe. This muſt be done by the voice of God in his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed Word, which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands and forbids, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore abſolves or binds.</p>
                  <p>No ſubject you know hath this power, to releaſe or bind of himſelfe, but that is the royall prerogative of the King. It is true, if the Word
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:58851:165"/> condemnes us, then our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences may doe ſo too; and if the Word abſolves us, ſo may our conſciences too: But this is <hi>virtute prima,</hi> not <hi>virtute propria;</hi> It is becauſe the Word doth it, not becauſe Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of it ſelfe without the Word can doe either rightly.</p>
                  <p>Whence two things ariſe to informe and direct us: <hi>viz.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. Satans judgment of our <note place="margin">Satans judging is but uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped.</note> eſtate is but uſurped: It doth not belong to him to ſit upon our ſoules: It is againſt the Law of Nations, that the ſame party ſhould be witneſſe and Judge: And we may ſay to him truly, what the Phariſees proudly objected to Chriſt, <hi>By what authority doth he theſe things?</hi> Or as they to <hi>Moſes, who made thee a Judge over us?</hi> Aſſuredly the enemy of our ſalvation is not to be the Judge of it, he being ſo maliciouſly
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:58851:165"/> vowed againſt our happineſſe, it is moſt unfit for him to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide it: and therefore though he uſurps a judgement upon Chriſtians, yet as <hi>David</hi> ſpake in another caſe, <hi>Thou Lord wilt not leave the righteous when he is judged;</hi> No aſſuredly, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan ſhall one day be judged for taking upon him the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Gods people: And doe you thinke that Satan will give a true judgement unto us of our ſpirituall condition, who dares give in falſe evidence before God himſelfe of <hi>Job,</hi> and who is ſaid to accuſe the brethren before God day and night?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. No teſtimony is to be admitted, which is contrary to the judgment of the Word: <hi>Beleeve not every ſpirit, 1 Joh.</hi> 4. <note place="margin">All judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our eſtates, being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Word, is falſe.</note> 1. <hi>but try the ſpirits, whether they are of God.</hi> The Word muſt judge us another day, &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is to judge of us now.</p>
                  <pb n="310" facs="tcp:58851:166"/>
                  <p>Satans judgement is uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped, and our owne is oft times erroneous, as in wicked and preſumptuous ſinners, who ſentence well for their ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, although God doth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claime and pronounce bitter woes unto them.</p>
                  <p>And as our judgements are oft times erroneous, ſo are they in the times of diſtreſſe, ſuſpicious and haſty: We doe not teſtifie of our ſelves with judgements cleared, and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally informed by the Word, of all our eſtate, but with judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments affected and diſtempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; as <hi>David</hi> in his fit, <hi>I am caſt out of thy preſence;</hi> God did not caſt him off, but his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempered judgement did caſt him out.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Maintain the judgment of the Word, againſt all judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: When a man hath throughly viewed and pierced into the ſecrets of his heart
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:58851:166"/> and wayes by the informing light of Gods bleſſed Spirit, and takes his fleſh and ſpirit aſunder, I meane his ſinnes, weakneſſes, graces and diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions, and layes theſe, with all he knows of himſelfe, before the Lord in a moſt ſincere in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuity, ſo that if he were now to die, he durſt venture the eternall ſalvation of his ſoule, with his God, that hee keeps nothing back, either of what is his owne by nature, or of what is Gods by grace: If now the Word decides for him, that his condition is hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly, his heart is upright, hee is indeed one who is truly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſſed in Chriſt; this man or woman ſhould now uphold this deciſive teſtimony of the Word, lay it up as the great copy of his eternall ſalvation; and in caſe of oppoſite verdict and teſtimony, not to moleſt himſelfe with reaſoning and
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:58851:167"/> doubting, but to preſerve the authority of Gods teſtimony, by beleeving, and moſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right walking with God in all the powers of duty.</p>
                  <p>There yet remaine two ſprings of doubtings to be cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and then I have done with that ſubject.</p>
                  <p>13. The thirteenth ſpring of doubtings, was, the new ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of old ſinnes: This I told you could not but amaze the ſoule, to ſee the dead riſe out of the grave againe, and to reade the debt as if it were not yet croſſed: It doth excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly diſquiet us about our ſpirituall condition. Now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. There are five times <note place="margin">Five times in which former ſins may revive</note> when we and our ſinnes doe meet.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. One is the day of our le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall humiliation, when the Law, like ſearching phyſick, enters deep, ſtirs up the evill
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:58851:167"/> humour, caſts our ſins into our very faces, and ſets them in order before us, and reproves us for them with undenyable conviction and horrour.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Another is, the day of our piercing afflictions, when the Lord doth ſend his meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers unto us of wrath, cuts off fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> us our delights, tears away our joyes, croſſeth us in our aims, and we ſee God hewing our friends from us, our chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren from us, our earthly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights and contents: for miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable evils are oft times a cauſe to make us ſee our ſinfull evils: We doe many times come to perceive our faults, by our pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments: As <hi>Pharaoh</hi> did, when the plagues were on him, <hi>I have done evill in not let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the people goe:</hi> And <hi>Balaam,</hi> when he ſaw the Angel, and heard him threatning, <hi>I will now returne:</hi> And ſo the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Iſrael, then ſaw, and
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:58851:168"/> confeſt their murmuring and ſtubbornneſſe, when God ſent evil Angels amongſt them, <hi>(i.)</hi> ſome meſſengers of his wrath and diſpleaſure.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. A third is, the time of ſome horrible and common judgement, whether it be up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on particular perſons, or a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, intereſſed in the ſame guilt of ſinne with our ſelves; For this is a time of common fire, which raging and flying up and downe, makes men run into their cloſets, and bring out their concealed jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els; ſo doe common and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary judgments return us into our ſelves, and gives up unto us thoſe our hidden ſins which we feare will draw the ſame fire of judiciall wrath upon our owne perſons. I doe not doubt but at the laſt great Plague, many of the ſinfull botches broke out, upon a fear leſt that judiciall botch ſhould
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:58851:168"/> have broken in upon your bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies and houſes.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. A fourth time is, the time of death: For though ſin and a ſinner really meet in all their courſe of life, yet ſenſe of ſin and a ſinner doe not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes meet untill the day of death; for death is a ſtrict and unavoidable ſummons to give up our accounts, and then the unjuſt ſteward muſt look a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout him, how he ſhall anſwer his moſt juſt Lord and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter.</p>
                  <p>This time of meeting, evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently manifeſts it ſelfe to our owne experience; who though we have kindled our ſinnes in the time of our health and ſtrength, yet have we not met with the flaſhes of them but in the times of ſickneſſe and weakneſſe.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. A laſt time of meeting is, the day of Judgement; and this is a moſt certaine and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:58851:169"/> time; It is poſſible for a man to eſcape the legall mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, by conviction; and the miſerable meeting, by afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, judgements, and death it ſelfe; (for ſome die like <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal,</hi> they live wretchedly, and die ſenſleſly) but at the day of Judgement, they and their ſinnes muſt meet, and ſhall; becauſe then the ſecrets of all hearts ſhall be diſcloſed, and Gods righteous judgement ſhall be evident to the hearts of all the world. Whence it is, that in this day of meeting, <hi>they ſhall cry unto the mountaines to fall on them, and the rocks to hide them</hi> (but in vaine) <hi>from the wrath of him who ſits upon the throne.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. There are ſeverall cauſes of the riſing of ſin: Some are <note place="margin">Divers cauſes of ſins riſing afreſh.</note> on Gods part, ſome on our part, ſome on Satans.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. For Gods part: God doth many times cauſe our
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:58851:169"/> former ſins to riſe, by the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of his mighty ſpirit in the miniſtery of his Word: For whereas the ſinner would huſh his fears, and griefs, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience aſleep, yet the Lord will not have it ſo: He doth rub the ſore, and gall the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, makes it ſenſible of the guilt and wounds; Hee doth pierce by the two-edged ſword of his Word, even to the dividing aſunder of ſoule and ſpirit, and of the joynts and marrow, and diſcernes the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thoughts and intents of the heart. He meets the perſon oft times many years after the commiſſion of the ſinnes, and moſt expreſly revives and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>members them in all the act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing circumſtances, which the ſinning perſon either had, or would have buried in ſilence and forgetfulneſſe.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. For our part: Thus there is double cauſe of new riſing of
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:58851:170"/> old ſins: One whereof is good, and the other is bad.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. A new commiſſion of the old ſins, which brings back upon us the ſting of the old guilt; for relapſes into the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, occaſion a relapſe of the burden and ache: Cut thy fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger againe, and it will ſmart againe; fall into thy ague a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, it will make thee ſhake againe: Relapſes have ever this judgement with them, that they make a freſh wound, and the old alſo to bleed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine. You know in ſome Wells, there are two buckets, put downe the one, and you bring up the other; ſo the fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling into the ſame ſin againe, brings up the old burden a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine. <note place="margin">Though we may not revive ſinne to practiſe it, yet we may to mourn for it.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Renewed humiliations; for then we doe voluntarily look back upon our former accounts, that thereby we may more humbly ſue out a totall
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:58851:170"/> diſcharge. Though wee may ſin the ſin over no more, yet we may weep it over and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver; and though the acting of it may be no more, yet the bewailing of it ſhould laſt us ever.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. On Satans part, who like an envious and malicious wretch never gives over to throw unto us our errors and failings, though corrected with trueſt reformation. So Satan, who is the great cauſe and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centive to ſin, will not ceaſe after our trueſt repentance, to vexe, and ſad, and (if he could, to) deſpaire our hearts with the freſh memory of former and forſaken ſins; ſo that we ſeldome or never lay hand on a bleſſed promiſe, or gaine our ſelves into the comfortable fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of God, or delight our ſelves in the ſweet peace of conſcience, but he falls in, and checks, and troubles us with
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:58851:171"/> the repreſentations of former ſins, and perchance makes us let goe our gracious hold, with the feares, and ſuſpici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and chargements of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer guilts.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Now according to the variety of the cauſes, fetching up upon us our former guilts, muſt we deliver unto you ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall helps and remedies.</p>
                  <p>Conſider therefore, on Gods <note place="margin">The ends of reviving of ſin.</note> part, there are ſeverall ends in reſpect of ſeverall perſons, why he brings on the ſinnes againe.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. To make the ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work more deep and ſure: We make our tents too ſhort for our wounds; Wee ſinne much, and defile our ſelves much, and we think that a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle waſhing will ſerve the turne. O! this buſineſſe of ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tryall, of laying the axe to the root of the tree, of diving into the ſecrets of ſin, of applying
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:58851:171"/> the corraſives unto the core &amp; heart of our natures, this goes againſt us, wee are quickly weary of it.</p>
                  <p>Indeed, ſome trouble, and ſome bitterneſſe we grant to be convenient; but to be ſtill accuſing our ſelves before God, ſtill to be laſhing and wounding our hearts for wounding of God, Ah, this, this goes againſt us.</p>
                  <p>You ſhall ſee people ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times very ſenſible of their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſed bodies: O now ſome phyſick were good, they find ſuch aches, ſuch diſtempers, ſurely ſome phyſick were good; and ſome they take, which makes them exceſſively ſick; but then away with it, no more phyſick: yet at length the diſeaſe comes upon them againe, and the Phyſitian pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes more phyſick, even that which muſt goe to the root of the diſeaſe, which
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:58851:172"/> though it makes them more ſick, yet it procures their ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and better health.</p>
                  <p>Beloved, God would have men (perhaps) a longer ſpace to ſit upon their ſinnes; they ſtint themſelves after great ſins, and make themſelves friends with God prefently. Now the Lord knowes that this skinning of the ſore will ſpoile all, and therefore after a ſhort time he returnes them their ſins againe, makes Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience to ſtartle at the guilt againe, and deales with us as the skilfull Chirurgion with a man whoſe leg is broken, and ill ſet, he breaks it againe, that it may be well ſet.</p>
                  <p>So doth the Lord, he breaks our ſoules againe with the guilt of ſins; He will make us know, that wee muſt bring him more broken hearts; we ſhall know what it is to ſinne againſt him, and ſhall not
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:58851:172"/> make a reall and laſting peace without a ſound and ſolid hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation.</p>
                  <p>And truly this is the great mercy of his wiſdome to work thus; for hereby he makes our foundation low, and ſure, and hereby he prevents ſubſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent ſtirs, and makes way for our ſurer and more comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble apprehenſions and appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations of his love in Chriſt. You know that a wiſe School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſter, when a boy skips from a hard leſſon to that which is more eaſie, he puts him back againe, and makes him ſay it over and over, ere he takes it forth. Men think to be catch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at Chriſt, however they love to lay load on him, and throw their vile burdens upon him, though perhaps they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver yet weighed their vile ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and diſhonourings of God: But the Lord will turne them back againe, he will take
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:58851:173"/> off theſe pragmaticall preſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers, and ſet them to learne their firſt leſſon better: He will make them more ſenſible of their vile hearts, and waies, and actions; they ſhall not ſo eaſily come off from their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſed tranſgreſſions; the Lord will hold up the comfortable anſwers of his favours, and the ſweet taſts of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and make them againe to ſit downe in bitter ſorrow for piercing the Lord Chriſt, and ſhedding his bloud, and grieving of his Spirit, and all that men might be more hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, and more really fitted for Chriſt.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. To make us more hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. I aſſure you oft times our very victories make us proud, and that very grace which ſhould be a cauſe to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſe us, occaſionally and acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentally is a means to puffe us: we riſe too often above our
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:58851:173"/> ſelves, beyond meaſure: And therefore as to <hi>Paul</hi> there was given a ſting to abaſe him, leſt <note place="margin">And that we might beſtow our tears &amp; not our tongues on others ſinning.</note> he ſhould be over-exalted; ſo to many Chriſtians the Lord doth returne unto them the ſenſible ſting of ſome notable guilt, to abaſe their hearts, to put them in mind of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
                  <p>For this reduction of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer gilt, it gives up unto us our baſe and treacherous natures, and the births of our owne hearts: Ah! faith ſuch a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, this heart, this nature of mine, what was it? what is it, if the Lord leaves it? See here the grapes, the ſowre grapes of this wild-vine, little reaſon have I to be ſo highly concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of my ſelf, as long as I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive ſuch loath ſome accounts and iſſues from my ſelfe.</p>
                  <p>And veri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>y, it makes us oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to deſpiſe our ſelves, to abhorre our ſelves in duſt and
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:58851:174"/> aſhes: And this is one great <note place="margin">Our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent graces make us good, and the ſenſe of former ſins keeps us humble</note> end and uſe which the Lord makes of former ſins, To keep the heart in a very humble frame: We muſt have ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing or other ſtill put unto us of our owne, which will let us ſee how fooliſh we are by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that is <hi>Davids</hi> phraſe, and how brutiſh we were, that is <hi>Solomons</hi> phraſe.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. To make us more care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full: For the ſharp remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of ſinne doth in a godly heart work ſtronger deteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and ſtronger watchful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe: God doth make their <note place="margin">Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring the gall &amp; the worm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood, <hi>Lam.</hi> 3.</note> new conſiderations to be our preſent preventi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>e are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times prevented by new impreſſions of former ſins.</p>
                  <p>What? ſhould I ſinne thus again? ſaith the humble heart: have I not reaſon to cruſh theſe births? to crucifie that bitter root, to pray againſt it,
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:58851:174"/> to watch againſt it, to reſiſt it, to deny it, which hath beene and is now a ſword in my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience?</p>
                  <p>But now conſider that there is a double carefulneſſe wrought by the new riſing of ſinne.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. One reſpects the guilt of it; and here our care is to get our acquitance renewed and inlar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged. O how doth the Lord by theſe riſings of ſin, ſoone cauſe the ſoule to riſe up in ſuing out his grace and favour<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> It cauſeth many a teare, many a prayer, many a wreſtling with God, many preſſings upon the promiſes, many an earneſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeching to have our pardon and diſcharge more fully ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led unto our conſciences, by the bloud of Jeſus Chriſt, and teſtimony of the Spirit.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Another reſpects the ſins themſelves, in their corrupt qualities, and inclinations, and
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:58851:175"/> motions; and this is a greater ſtudy againſt them: firmer re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions, ſtrengthning of co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venants, confirmations of grace, of circumſpection, of deteſtation, of reſiſtance, of any thing or way by which the powers of ſin may be more ſubdued and caſt downe.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. To make us more thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full: Perhaps the Lord hath pardoned thoſe ſins which riſe anew in thy heart; they doe not alwayes riſe, becauſe God hath not diſcharged their guilt, but becauſe thou haſt not diſcharged thy new debt; they ariſe as a debt, for the diſcharge of a debt: as we uſe to put men in mind of their former miſeries, not that thereby they are made miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, but becauſe thereby they ſhould be made thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full. Beloved, to have former ſins diſcharged, it is mercy, I ſay mercy, yea and a rich mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:58851:175"/> greater then to give a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned perſon life, or to give an impriſoned perſon liberty, far greater: No ſuch mercy as that which blots out our ſins, which ſaves a ſoule from hell, and gives it pardon and life. Now great mercies ſhould be anſwered with great thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe: Thou didſt, in the ſenſe and ſting of thy guilt, go with an heavy heart, with bitter ſighes, with deep oppreſſions, O that I had mercy! O this burden! O this wound! O this ſinne! Yea and with deep pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtations, If the Lord will but pardon it, If he will ſhew me mercy, If he would receive me graciouſly, he ſhould have the calves of my lips, I would love him indeed, I would ſerve him, I would praiſe and thank him, I would ſpeak good of his name, I would ſay, <hi>Who is a God like him, that forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth iniquities, tranſgreſſions and
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:58851:176"/> ſins, and paſſeth by the ſins of his people?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Well, the Lord hath ſhewed himſelfe like himſelfe, a God very gracious and mercifull; but we perhaps have ſhewed our ſelves like our ſelves, in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſes, earneſt, and full of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes; but in our exemptions, flat, and full of forgetfulneſſe. Now the Lord doth excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly diſlike this vanity and doubting of heart; he loves that mercy ſhould be ſtill ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged to be mercy? he would have us to look back, as well as to look up; and to give him thanks for that mercy, for which not long ſince wee would have given all the world and our ſoules too: And therefore doth he caſt unto us our accounts, he lets us thereby ſee what they were, and what he hath done, that wee may confeſſe our error for not anſwering great mercy with
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:58851:176"/> great thankfulneſſe.</p>
                  <p>But perhaps you will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Ob. </seg>
                     </label> What if we our ſelves for our part be the cauſe of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viving of former guilt and ſting of former ſins?</p>
                  <p>I anſwer, If it be by way of <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Sol. </seg>
                     </label> humiliation, to ſeek the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, and to make confeſſion to the God of mercy, and to get victory over them, this ſhould no way diſcourage us; for this is no more hurt or prejudice to the ſoule, then the after laying open of the wound to the Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgion to dreſſe and cure it, is prejudiciall to the ſafety and welfare of the body.</p>
                  <p>But if it be by way of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, either by relapſing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ſame ſins, or multiply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of ſinne in another kinde, (both which will dig up again our buried and fore-paſt guilts) then I know no way of peace and ſafety, no way to allay theſe renewed accuſations
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:58851:177"/> and ſtings, but by renewed ſorrow and repentance. And verily what I delivered unto you heretofore about recovery from relapſing, that is the courſe preſently to be taken here: O let us haſte in before the Lord with hearts trickling down with tears of bloud, for old and preſent wounds: the very abundance of ſorrow, the bitterneſſe of griefe, the art of ſelf-affliction, I cannot ſay that ſorrow of ſorrow, that hatred of hatred, that indignation of indignation, that revenge of revenge, that repentance of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, which are here ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily required, and that too with longeſt continuance. Doe what thou wilt, ſhuffle off, cut to thy ſelfe a peace, thou ſhalt never have it, thy ſinnes ſhall ever and anon gall, and vexe, and wound thee, untill thou haſt renewed thy bitterneſſe of moſt humbled ſorrow for
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:58851:177"/> renewing thy filthineſſe and baſeneſſe of thy audacious ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.</p>
                  <p>But then ſuppoſe, that Satan <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Ob. </seg>
                     </label> through his malicious art doth revive our former guilt by his accuſations, for our greater in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terruption and diſquietment; what is now to be done?</p>
                  <p>I will ſhew you here briefly <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Sol. </seg>
                     </label> two things:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. One is, how you may know that the reviving of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer guilt be from Satan or no.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Another is, what is then to be done by us.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. You may know that <note place="margin">How to know whether Satan re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vives for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ſins.</note> your ſins are revived by Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, from two effects.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. One is from the deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate iſſues of their reviving: you may know whether a man be a friend, or a malicious ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, who doth revive the er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors and failings amongſt men; a friend, hee revives
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:58851:178"/> them that you may be bette<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red either to reforme, if the thing be evill, or to be circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect whether the thing be true or falſe; but the malicious enemy he revives them, onely to make you odious and loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome. Now Satans reviving of former ſins is ever odious, it is of evill, for evill, his end is deſperate: What is that? That is, that we might give up all poſſible intereſts in mercy, all hope of pardon and accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. Whence it is, where he revives ſins, former ſins, hee bends the heart to ſome pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent miſchiefe, to renounce all hope of mercy, and to ſelfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murder, and ſuch deſperate iſſues; both which are againſt the ends of God, and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires of an holy heart; which upon their reviving of ſinne, doe ever propoſe mercy and betterment unto the ſoule.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Another is from the fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:58851:178"/> iſſues, which is this: Hee revives the ſting of ſinne, that he may make us more bold and mad in ſinning: He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vives ſin unto ſin, there is no hope of mercy, of recovery, therefore as good to goe on as not: Whence he inclines the heart to a leaping into the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, to a wallowing in the mire, to a greedineſſe in the courſe of ſinning; which hee doth the more eaſily win from the evill hearts of evill men, by thoſe temporary allay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and ceſſations of ſting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing guilt, which they obſerve in themſelves, by their furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe, conſtant, and hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning revolutions or exerciſe of the ſame ſins.</p>
                  <p>So that, if you whoſe hearts are tender, have been hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled for former ſins, and are ſo upright as ſtill to hate them, if former g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>ilts be revived with an inclination either to
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:58851:179"/> give up all mercy, or to give over your ſelves now with li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centiouſneſſe to the ſame or other ſins; here is Satan in this, Satan now revives thy guilt, and now another courſe is to be taken.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The courſe then is this, and I beſeech you mark it;</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Strengthen thy heart with more deteſtations of the ſins: The more he revives the guilty accuſation, the more doe thou revive thy upright deteſtations: And as he poures out malice to diſturb thy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, ſo doe thou poure out revenge to ſub due the grounds of it: And if he vexeth thee, doe thou goe and vexe thy ſinnes.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Beleeve not a malicious <note place="margin">Thy caſe is not wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe a wicked devill ſaith ſo.</note> accuſer: Satan doth oft times ſerve a Writ in the Kings name, without the Kings ſeale; he forgives where God doth not, and he binds where God

                  <p n="3">3. But in caſe of frequent inquietations, when Satan will not be anſwered, but ſtill char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth, now make thine appeale <note place="margin">The Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian muſt appeale.</note> from him to God; and if he charge thee in the Court of Conſcience, remove it wiſely to the higher court of heaven; let God once more have the hearing, and the deciding. And now Satan, what haſt thou to ſay unto me? Thou haſt ſinned heretofore, (ſaith Satan) and thy Judge doth know the truth of this indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.

The ſpeech of conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence: <note place="margin">The ſpeech of conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, what</note> This is no more then its teſtimony for us, or againſt us; for conſcience is intimate with our ſecret frames, and intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and motives, and actions: By its naturall light it can tell much, by implanted light more, by renewed and ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied light, moſt of all Now the ſpeech of conſcience for us, is nothing elſe but an approbati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of our eſtate, anſwerable to the Word, acquiting us againſt all feares and objections that we are the ſons of God, that we are truly changed, that we ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:58851:181"/> love him, beleeve in Chriſt, and walk before him: for really the voice of Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is but the eccho of the voice of the Word, and ſaith that unto us touching our par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, what the Word deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers in the generall. Its voice is but the Aſſumption, and the voice of the Word is but the Propoſition: The Word ſaith, that ſhould be; and Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence ſaith, here it is: The Word requires ſuch and ſuch things in a man to be ſaved, and who is in favour with God, and Conſcience brings them out, and anſwers for the perſon.</p>

The ſpeechleſneſſe, or ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence <note place="margin">The ſpeechleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of conſcience what it is.</note> of conſcience, is the ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſion of its determining and acquiting acts touching our eſtate in generall, or touching ſome particular doubts: Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times conſcience calls upon us, and ſometimes we call upon
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:58851:181"/> conſcience. In matters of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection to practiſe or forbea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, we uſually heare a reall and inward word, Do it not, or, Thou mayſt do it: In after doubts we call upon conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence for its teſtimony, In the uprightneſſe of my heart did I it, and my conſcience doth beare me witneſſe.</p>
                  <p>Now of all the ſilences of conſcience, that is heavieſt which befalls us in our ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall combats and tryals; wherein our gracious conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is queſtioned, but cannot be iſſued, becauſe conſcience holds up, and doth not teſtifie for us by any ſenſible approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and acquitance, which is cauſed diverſly.</p>

                  <p n="2">2. Sometimes through diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regard to the voice of God in the Miniſtery; for Conſcience takes not that well, which the Word takes ill: and therefore God doth uſually make us know our neglects of his Word, by the ſilences of our conſciences: And aſſuredly ſomething is ordinarily a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſe, when Conſcience ſpeaks unto us neither good nor bad.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Sometimes Conſcience is ſilent, to make us look high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er then Conſcience, and that wee might know there is a higher Court to which wee muſt make our addreſſes.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Sometimes Conſcience is ſilent, to make us ſee upon what bottomes our faith is grounded, whether we can be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve, becauſe God ſaith, as well as rejoyce, becauſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience ſpeaketh.</p>

                  <p>3. But to make Conſcience ſpeak, what muſt we doe? We have had its gracious teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, by which we have been much comforted and ſuppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: How ſhall we recover it to ſpeech againe?</p>

            <p n="1">1. SEnſe of ſinfull workings. O! ſaith a diſtreſſed ſoul, Certainly my condition is ſtark naught, and I have no right to Chriſt, nor to any mercy, I may not beleeve: Why? Becauſe I never found ſuch vile workings of heart as of late: I feele a wonderfull rebellion in my heart; I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not think on any good, nor ſet upon any good, but an army of evill is in me, oppoſing and hindering me.</p>
            <p>To a ſoule in ſuch a condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Sol. </seg>
               </label> I would (for his help) preſcribe theſe five ſubſequent conſiderations.</p>
            <p n="1">1. When grace comes in truth, it is ever of that power
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:58851:184"/> to make ſuch diſcoveries, and to raiſe ſuch ſtirs, as the ſoule never felt before; for Grace is a new nature, and a new light, and a new active principle. It is put into the ſoul for that ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry end, to find and lay out ſin, yea and to expell and thruſt it out. The judgement was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo convinced before, nor Conſcience ſo qualified be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, nor the will and affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons ſo ſpiritualized before: therefore never marvell at the ſtrange workings. When a child is conceived in the wombe, it is not now with the woman as in former times; and whenſoever Chriſt is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in the ſoule, it is not with that ſoule as in old times. There is that now falne in, which muſt purge thee and rule thee.</p>
            <p n="2">2. If good be wrought, evil will work and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>. When Chriſt was born, all Jeruſalem
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:58851:185"/> was troubled; ſo when grace is wrought, ſin will ſtir. Indeed if grace came into the ſoule ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by a finall and totall ceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation of ſin, that there were no ſin reſiding in the ſoule, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the which grace comes, then thou ſhouldſt feele no ſtir at all: Thus it ſhall be in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; Grace there ſhall be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone; Holineſſe, and nothing but holineſſe there, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore no combat, no ſtir: But thus it never will be on earth: Sinne may be alone in ſome mens hearts, but grace is never alone in any mans heart in this life. Or if grace came into the ſoule by a peaceable reſignati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, if ſinfull fleſh would with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any more adoe make a full and free ſurrender, and give it poſſeſſion without any diſpute and cavill, then alſo thou mightſt expect a calm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and a ceſſation of armes, no vile ſtirrings. But O Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian,
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:58851:185"/> Grace and ſin, <hi>The Spirit</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Gal. 5. 17.</note> 
               <hi>and the fleſh are contrary one to the other,</hi> and therefore they <hi>luſt</hi> one againſt the other. Fire and water will not lie quiet. Sad indeed were thy conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, if thou hadſt ſuch a frame of (vaine) good, againſt which no ſinfull part in thee would oppoſe.</p>
            <p>Every regenerate man hath a double man in him, the new man, and the old man; that would doe good, this would not doe good; that would pray, this would not; that would mourn, this would not; that would beleeve, this would not.</p>
            <p n="3">3. But then thirdly, thou who feeleſt ſuch a rebelling and oppoſing fleſh in thee, what is that which thou doſt oppoſe? It is true, thou feeleſt an untoward, rebellious nature yet within thee, but what ſide takeſt thou? <hi>It is not I,</hi> ſaid <note place="margin">Rom. 7.</note>
               <pb n="350" facs="tcp:58851:186"/> 
               <hi>Paul, but ſin that dwelleth in me.</hi> Sin in him oppoſed good, but <hi>Paul</hi> himſelfe approved good, and delighted in good, and willed good.</p>
            <p>The ſame Apoſtle ſpeaking of the co-habitation, and the co-operation of fleſh and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit in regenerate perſons, that the one did <hi>luſt</hi> againſt the other, and the one was <hi>contrary</hi> to the other, and that by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the rebellion and unru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe of the one, <hi>we could not</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Gal 5. 17.</note> 
               <hi>doe the good which we would;</hi> he yet comforteth them in ſuch a condition in the next words, <hi>If ye be led by the Spirit,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">ver. 18.</note> 
               <hi>ye are not under the Law.</hi> As if he had ſaid, Notwithſtanding all this rebellious oppoſition of your fleſh, if yet ye yeeld not to be ſervants to it, but ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove of, and incline unto, and follow in your hearts &amp; cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes the rules of the Spirit, the condition is very good &amp; ſafe.</p>
            <pb n="351" facs="tcp:58851:186"/>
            <p>So that though the evill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining in us doth oppoſe the good in us, yet if we our ſelves oppoſe not the good, our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition may be good.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Fourthly, as there is evill in thee oppoſing of thee in any good, ſo there is ſomething in thee alſo oppoſing of that evil. Doſt thou not condemne that hardneſſe which hinders thee from mourning, and ſheddeſt many a teare becauſe thou canſt not mourne? Doſt thou not ſtrive with the Lord by many prayers, and in the uſe of all his ordinances againſt that unbeleeving and rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly working nature of thine? Doſt thou not with <hi>Paul,</hi> conflict with it, groane under it, cry out, <hi>O wretched man that I am, who ſhall deliver me?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And ſurely neither the ſenſe of this, nor the reſiſtance of this, nor ſecond deſires of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance from this, can be
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:58851:187"/> any evill ſigns of thy condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Laſtly, in the ſenſe of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward rebellions and work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, thy way is not to nouriſh doubting, but thy duty it is to ſtir up beleeving.</p>
            <p>When <hi>Paul</hi> felt that agony twixt the law of his members and the law of his minde, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed he was much troubled at it, but yet he did not conclude againſt his condition in grace; No, but he acquits that, <hi>(Rom.</hi> 7. 25. <hi>So then with the mind I my ſelf ſerve the Law of God, though with the fleſh the law of ſinne)</hi> and ſets his faith to worke, <hi>ver.</hi> 24. <hi>Who ſhall deliver mee? ver.</hi> 25. <hi>I thanke God, through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord.</hi> Mark his practiſe: This is my condition, I feele rebellious luſts, yea I feele them ſometimes captiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of me, what courſe ſhall I now take to be delivered of them? to vanquiſh them? I
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:58851:187"/> conflict with them, but I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not conquer them: I cannot conquer them, yea but Jeſus Chriſt can conquer them, and deliver me from them, and to him will I goe by faith.</p>
            <p>Thus muſt thou doe in the ſenſe of that native rebellion and vile operation of thy fleſh: Thou muſt by faith goe unto Chriſt, thou muſt acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge thy vileneſſe, and thy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficiency, and alſo his ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency: Thou muſt exalt Jeſus Chriſt by faith in his Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torſhip, and truſt on him, that he will by his Almighty Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit crucifie thy ſinfull fleſh more, and (which was one end of his comming into the world) deſtroy thoſe works of ſin and Satan.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Another cauſe of doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in a Chriſtian, may be the ſenſe of wrath. O! ſaith ſuch a one, would you have me to beleeve, or imagine you that I
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:58851:188"/> can doe ſo, I who feele the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry wrath of God in my ſoule, and the terrors of the Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty wounding me for my tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions? What, can or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> I beleeve mercy for me, who now feele wrath upon me? can I beleeve that God will be mercifull, whom I ſenſibly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend to be wrathfull?</p>
            <p>This is a notable caſe, and <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Sol. </seg>
               </label> needs a wary and circumſpect reſolution: Nevertheleſſe I ſhall at leaſt endeavour to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>girt this burden for a troubled ſoule.</p>
            <p n="1">1. There are two ſorts of perſons who in this life may feele the wrath of God.</p>
            <p>Firſt, ſuch as are unqueſtio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably wicked: of whom ſome of them feele the wrath of God, as the beginning of their everlaſting perdition: That wrath inflicted on them is but the beginning of a juſt hell due unto them. Thus <hi>Judas</hi>
               <pb n="355" facs="tcp:58851:188"/> felt the wrath of God: And ſome of them feele the wrath of God as a meanes for their humiliation and converſion. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> they in <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 37. who were <hi>pricked in their hearts,</hi> and thereupon cryed out, <hi>What ſhall we doe?</hi> felt the wrath of God.</p>
            <p>Secondly, ſuch as are unque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtionably good; of whom ſome have felt Gods wrath in caſe of deſertion, as <hi>Heman, Ezra, Job,</hi> and others; and ſome in caſe of notorious cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption or ſinning, as <hi>David,</hi> whoſe <hi>bones</hi> were <hi>broken</hi> for it, and <hi>Gods face hid</hi> from him for it, and his <hi>moiſture turned into the drought of ſummer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Againe, you muſt diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh of thoſe effects which appeare in perſons under the ſenſe of divine wrath, for they are twofold.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Some feele the wrath of God, and are either onely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:58851:189"/> againſt God with blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemies, or inraging their hearts the more to goe on in ſinning againſt God, thinking at leaſt by the pleaſure of ſinne to drowne the ſenſe of wrath, or running into abſolute de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpaire of Gods mercy; and therefore never attempting any courſe of repentance, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they give up all hope of mercy. Where there is ſuch a ſenſe of wrath as this, in all reſpects, and for ever, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition is very fearfull.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Some feele the wrath of God, and are hereupon (occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionally) induced either to the ſtudy and care of an holy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation of their ſinful hearts and wayes, or to a particular reſtauration of themſelves from groſſe ſins, into which they are falne, and for which now they feele the ſore diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſures of an angry Father.</p>
            <p>If thy condition be either of
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:58851:189"/> theſe, that thou feeleſt wrath, and that hath driven thee to a ſearch of thy naturall eſtate, and to the diſcovery of it, and to an humbling for it, and to all the meanes by which thou mayſt be delivered as well (and rather) from thy ſinful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, as from Gods wrath; or if this wrath felt awakens thy conſcience, and hath been a meanes to ſcourge thee out of ſome particular ſinning, to thy former and better walkings with God, thou mayſt now ſafely beleeve on mercy; yea though thou as yet feeleſt wrath, yet mayſt thou beleeve mercy: And my reaſon is this, becauſe now mercy is thy por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, thy condition now is right under many promiſes of mercy to pardon thee, for it is a truly penitentiall condition. See <hi>Eſay</hi> 55. 7. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18. 21, 22 <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 14. 1, 2, 4.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Though mercy be thy
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:58851:190"/> portion, yet know thou, that the ſenſe of wrath will not off, untill thou doſt beleeve actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally on that mercy. It is not mercy in the Promiſe which alone can remove the ſenſe of wrath, but it muſt be mercy applyed by faith: for till faith works in the ſoule of a man, till the poore ſoule looks on God through the Perſpective of faith, God appeares not as a mercifull, but as a wrath full God to it.</p>
            <p>And therefore thou being in ſuch a condition as I have delivered, thou mayſt ſafely venture on mercy, though thou feeleſt wrath, (the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named Saints did ſo) and upon beleeving thou ſhalt in due time feele the ſenſe of mercy to take off the ſenſe of wrath: Thy faith will ſee a reconciled God, and then thou ſhalt enjoy a pacified conſcience.</p>
            <p>3. A third cauſe of doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:58851:190"/> may be a condemning conſcience. But ſaith the trembling Chriſtian, My con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience tels me of my ſinnings, and of wonderfull ſinfulneſſe within me; and God is greater then my conſcience, who will aſſuredly condemne me; O I may not beleeve.</p>

            </list>
            <p n="1">1. A mans actions are condemned by Conſcience, when Conſcience being right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inlightned and inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Word of God, pronounceth of them that
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:58851:191"/> they are evill, and damnable; that they are contrary to Gods holineſſe and glory, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore are to be abhorred, and crucified, and forſaken.</p>
            <p n="2">2. A mans perſon is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned by conſcience, not onely when conſcience findes ſins in the perſon, but likewiſe the perſon in ſins; <hi>(i.)</hi> not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſuch corruptions in the heart, but alſo the heart ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving, and loving of them, and reſolved to keep them, and goe on in them.</p>
            <p>Now obſerve me in two Concluſions anſwerable to theſe two Propoſitions:</p>
            <p n="1">1. If Conſcience condemns thy perſon, I confeſſe thou haſt no reaſon to beleeve mercy for thy ſelfe; If thy conſcience tels thee to the face of God, thou art in a foule, ſinfull courſe, and haſt been called upon by the voice of the Word, and its voice to come
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:58851:191"/> out of it, and thou doſt not leave it, nay, art reſolved to purſue it, and to inſiſt on it, now God is greater then thy conſcience, and will aſſuredly condemne thee.</p>
            <p n="2">2. If conſcience condemns thy actions onely, then thou mayeſt, notwithſtanding that condemnation, beleeve on mercy. My meaning is this, Though the conſcience by its diſcerming light, repreſents un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thee much ſinfulneſſe in thy nature and former courſe, and though it doth condemne theſe to be vile, and moſt fit to be crucified, abhorred, and forſaken, this condemnation hinders not the right of belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving: Nay, no man indeed ſhould beleeve, unleſſe his conſcience doth condemne ſin in him; not onely ſhew him his ſinnes, but aſſure him that they are evill, and unworthy his love; nay moſt worthy of
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:58851:192"/> his deteſtation and mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Secondly, you muſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh of times, when con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience doth condemne a man; there are two times of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Some are open and free; He is himſelfe, and beſides that, he heares both parties, as well what is for himſelfe, as what is againſt himſelfe; yea and weighs matters in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie in the right ballance of Gods Sanctuary, not in Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans ballance of cunning ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtions. Will conſcience con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne thy perſon at ſuch a time, and under ſuch circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances? Nay, will not the Word of God acquit thee at ſuch a time againſt all feares, for the ſubſtance and reality of a pious condition?</p>
            <p n="2">2. Some are clouded &amp; dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, either with melancholy, or afflictions, or temptations,
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:58851:192"/> wherein the Chriſtian ſeeth his face through a falſe glaſſe, (juſt as a Title is made by a deceitfull &amp; cunning Lawyer) not according to truth, not all of it, but ſome of it: What is paſt heretofore for action and affection; or what hath falne out, not in the courſe of life ſince a mans converſion, but onely in caſe of ſurpriſall and captivity. Now perhaps con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience may condemne thee, but this is an illegall ſentence, it is a corrupted judgement, and is reverſible: God will not judge of thee, as Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in ſuch a caſe doth; Nay he will repeale it, and diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>null it.</p>
            <p n="4">4. A fourth cauſe of doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, is, a feare leſt a man hath ſinned that great ſin againſt the holy Ghoſt: And the main inducement to credit this, is, a ſinning againſt cleare know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, which is one ingredient
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:58851:193"/> in that ſinne. Now this is my condition, ſaith a troubled ſoul, I have not onely ſinned, but ſinned againſt light ſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in the Miniſtery, and working on my conſcience; therefore I may rather con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude then queſtion it, Mercy belongs not to me.</p>
            <p>To help a conſcience thus <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Sol. </seg>
               </label> inthralled, I would wiſh that ſuch a perſon would 1. Be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, 2. Be directed.</p>
            <p>1. The Information which I would commend in this caſe, is fourefold.</p>
            <p>Firſt, that the ſinne againſt the holy Ghoſt, is not any ſin which a man commits through ignorance: Whatſoever the ſinne or ſinnes have beene, (whereof the party ſtands guilty) whether againſt the Law, or againſt the Goſpel, ſuppoſe it be one, or many hainous ſinnes, yet if the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon be in a ſtate of blindneſſe
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:58851:193"/> and ignorance, if there is a neſcience of the fact, if hee knowes not what he doth, this ignorance priviledgeth the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings thus far, that therefore they are not the ſin againſt the holy Ghoſt.</p>
            <p>Secondly, the ſin againſt the holy Ghoſt is not any ſinne againſt the Goſpel, which is elicited and acted through a miſ-beliefe or miſ-perſwaſion: If the ſinne be a ſleighting of Euangelicall doctrines, nay a perſecuting of them, and of the profeſſors of them, yet if theſe acts of oppoſition depend to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally on error in the judgment, on a judgement miſ-perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, <hi>(i.)</hi> rather beleeving them not to be truths, rather think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thoſe wayes to be falſe wayes; I ſay this miſ-beliefe preſerves ſuch ſinnings yet from being ſins againſt the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <note place="margin">1 Tim. 1. 13.</note> Ghoſt, becauſe the ſinne againſt the holy Ghoſt ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:58851:194"/> light even to conviction and approbation. See <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 4. 5.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, the ſin againſt the holy Ghoſt is not every ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning againſt knowledge. Theſe are not reciprocall propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, every ſin againſt the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt is againſt knowledg, and every ſinne againſt know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge is the ſin againſt the holy Ghoſt. The former is true, but the latter is not; for many a converted man ſinneth againſt knowledge, who yet never ſinneth the ſin againſt the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt.</p>
            <p>In two caſes a man ſinning againſt knowledge, doth not yet ſin that ſin againſt the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt: One is, the caſe of a ſtrong and violent temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; Another is, the caſe of a ſudden and turbulent paſſion: It is the ſame with <hi>Peters</hi> caſe againſt his knowledg denying and forſwearing his Maſter.
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:58851:194"/> If <hi>Paul</hi> before his converſion had had <hi>Peters</hi> knowledge, he had ſinned this ſin againſt the holy Ghoſt; And if <hi>Peter</hi> in his denyall had had <hi>Pauls</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice joyned with his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, he had alſo ſinned that ſinne: but the miſ-beliefe of the one before his converſion, and the infirmity of the other after it, preſerved from this ſinne. Error miſ-led the one, and ſudden feare ſurpriſed the other.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, there are three horrible ſinnings which doe attend that ſinne againſt the holy Ghoſt; and the Scripture (which wee were beſt excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding warily to follow in reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving this caſe) expreſly deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers them.</p>
            <p n="1">1. One is, totall Apoſtaſie from the truths of Jeſus Chriſt knowne and taſted. The truths of Chriſt muſt 1. be knowne and apprehended, 2. knowne
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:58851:195"/> and taſted, they muſt be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved. 3. And then the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon falls from theſe. 4. Nay his fal is not particular, (which is incident to the beſt) it is a totall fall, not a falling in the way, but a falling from the way of truth. <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 4. <hi>If they were once inlightned and taſted, &amp;c. If, ver.</hi> 6. <hi>they ſhall fall away.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. A ſecond is, a malicious oppugnation of that truth which was once knowne and taſted, and from which now the perſon is falne, called <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 6. <hi>A crueifying of the Sonne of God afreſh,</hi> And <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 26. <hi>A</hi> 
               <note place="margin">And deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the spirit of Grace.</note> 
               <hi>wilfull ſinning after that we have received the knowledge of the truth.</hi> And it was evident in the Phariſees, who ſaw and knew the light, but hated, and perſecuted it unto the death.</p>
            <p>3. A third is, finall impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tencie. Whoſoever ſinnes the
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:58851:195"/> ſin againſt the holy Ghoſt, he neither doth repent, nor can repent: He is ſo juſtly and for ever forſaken of God, and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven up to a reprobate ſenſe, and a ſeared conſcience, that he cannot repent; though (per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps) he may ſee his courſe to be evill, yet it is impoſſible (ſaith the Apoſtle in <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 6.) to renew him to repentance.</p>
